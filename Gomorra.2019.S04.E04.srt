LONDON

3
00:03:23,943 --> 00:03:25,943
- Hi, Alberto.
- Hi.

4
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:31,539
- Did you call your friend?
- First thing I did.

5
00:03:31,541 --> 00:03:34,138
- What did she say?
- It's all set up.

6
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:36,897
Leena will get it done, you'll see.

7
00:03:36,899 --> 00:03:39,176
I've known her for 15 years,
she's a Mack truck.

8
00:03:39,178 --> 00:03:42,494
Now she's gone into business
with a genius of finance

9
00:03:42,496 --> 00:03:46,295
and I checked their acquisitions
over recent years, all blue chip.

10
00:03:55,652 --> 00:03:57,451
Thank you.

11
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,969
Gennaro, you need to relax.

12
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,245
I need to relax, Alberto?

13
00:04:13,645 --> 00:04:17,042
All I know is until a few days ago
everything was going well,

14
00:04:17,044 --> 00:04:19,880
now if I don't buy an international
company in two weeks,

15
00:04:19,882 --> 00:04:22,402
like fuck I'll open the airport.

16
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:27,518
That's not a good thing,
neither for me nor for you.

17
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,239
Don't ever forget that.

18
00:04:38,435 --> 00:04:40,595
Hello?

19
00:04:44,553 --> 00:04:46,193
Good.

20
00:04:48,432 --> 00:04:50,871
They've arrived.

21
00:05:09,544 --> 00:05:12,143
Get it done now,
we don't have a minute to lose.

22
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,779
- See you here in an hour.
- Right.

23
00:05:37,928 --> 00:05:39,022
Hello.

24
00:05:39,024 --> 00:05:40,067
Gennaro Savastano.

25
00:05:40,069 --> 00:05:41,279
Ah, Mr. Savastano.

26
00:05:41,281 --> 00:05:44,018
Our bank manager, Mr. Cormack
is waiting for you.

27
00:05:45,932 --> 00:05:48,303
Mr. Savastano,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

28
00:05:49,107 --> 00:05:50,396
This way, please.

29
00:07:08,246 --> 00:07:10,496
So, Mr. Savastano...

30
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,702
You put in your personal code,

31
00:07:12,796 --> 00:07:14,164
and here is your key card.

32
00:07:15,327 --> 00:07:18,533
If you need anything else, let me know.

33
00:07:18,535 --> 00:07:20,415
Thank you.

34
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:11,190
Hello.

35
00:08:11,278 --> 00:08:12,646
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

36
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:29,149
- Leena!
- Alberto!

37
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,372
I'm so glad to see you.

38
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,287
This is the person
I told you about,

39
00:08:33,303 --> 00:08:35,584
my partner, Mr. Gennaro Savastano.

40
00:08:38,076 --> 00:08:40,505
- Lovely to meet you.
- Please sit down.

41
00:08:45,061 --> 00:08:47,897
- Do you want something? A coffee?
- No, thank you.

42
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:50,188
I found what you asked for.

43
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,023
Or rather, my partner, Patrick did.

44
00:08:53,098 --> 00:08:54,427
He's fantastic.

45
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:56,823
But, given the short notice,
it wasn't easy.

46
00:08:57,287 --> 00:08:59,084
In the end, we were lucky.

47
00:09:00,285 --> 00:09:01,114
Anyway...

48
00:09:01,153 --> 00:09:04,146
I'm sure that you're in a hurry,
so... shall we go?

49
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,416
Patrick's waiting for us at the office
with more details.

50
00:09:07,694 --> 00:09:10,054
- He said that Patrick...
- I understood.

51
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:18,353
Let's go.

52
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,629
It's this-this way.

53
00:09:40,866 --> 00:09:42,647
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

54
00:09:42,784 --> 00:09:44,151
Patrick...

55
00:09:47,693 --> 00:09:50,092
Patrick Calvis, it's a pleasure.

56
00:09:50,183 --> 00:09:51,714
Gennaro Savastano.

57
00:09:52,213 --> 00:09:53,697
- Patrick.
- Alberto Resta,

58
00:09:53,743 --> 00:09:54,954
- Pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

59
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:57,005
Please come in, take a seat.

60
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:59,444
- Can I get anyone a coffee?
- No, thank you, Leena.

61
00:09:59,482 --> 00:10:01,185
Yes, please.

62
00:10:01,317 --> 00:10:02,317
Harry?

63
00:10:03,964 --> 00:10:07,782
So Leena tells me you've just
a couple of weeks to close the deal.

64
00:10:08,503 --> 00:10:10,464
Let's get straight to the point, sir.

65
00:10:20,491 --> 00:10:21,756
Wimpro.

66
00:10:21,804 --> 00:10:23,741
Market value: £20 million.

67
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,899
The price is not an issue.

68
00:10:40,351 --> 00:10:42,792
Well... well, Patrick...
But...

69
00:10:42,867 --> 00:10:45,094
if it's so, why do they need to sell?

70
00:10:45,171 --> 00:10:46,576
In the past year,

71
00:10:46,659 --> 00:10:48,612
Wimpro made some bad investments.

72
00:10:48,655 --> 00:10:50,514
Not through it's own fault,

73
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,589
now, they've been exposed and
they need to close a contract ASAP.

74
00:10:54,652 --> 00:10:55,316
But...

75
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,135
they haven't got the money
to do so all by themselves.

76
00:10:58,508 --> 00:11:00,000
So, apparently...

77
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:03,099
Wimpro need you
more than you need them.

78
00:11:03,599 --> 00:11:05,178
We just have to let them know.

79
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:07,540
Now, it's up to you.

80
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:12,288
Did you get that
or do I have to translate?

81
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:36,279
Well? How's it going?

82
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:40,277
For the moment, everything's okay.

83
00:11:45,715 --> 00:11:47,193
Here's Gaetano.

84
00:11:47,195 --> 00:11:51,271
- Who's that?
- A person who works for me in London.

85
00:11:51,273 --> 00:11:54,112
- Welcome, Mrs. Savastano.
- Thank you.

86
00:11:57,871 --> 00:12:00,030
Do you think it's good?

87
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:07,745
We have to go home
with an international company

88
00:12:07,747 --> 00:12:10,064
to head up the consortium

89
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:13,944
or else Casillo's friend won't give us
the contract for the airport.

90
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,982
So you've already decided?

91
00:12:26,331 --> 00:12:28,018
- For you, madam.
- Thank you.

92
00:12:30,436 --> 00:12:31,538
And for you, sir.

93
00:12:31,578 --> 00:12:33,217
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

94
00:12:41,534 --> 00:12:45,453
They asked me
to make an irrevocable bid.

95
00:12:47,532 --> 00:12:49,891
An irrevocable bid?

96
00:12:54,969 --> 00:12:56,608
And I did.

97
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,709
This city has always
made me feel anxious.

98
00:13:52,148 --> 00:13:54,107
Me too.

99
00:14:20,331 --> 00:14:22,128
- Is everything okay?
- Not really.

100
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:23,956
- We have a problem.
- What's happened?

101
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:26,974
The owners, the Mayers family
have asked for a partners meeting.

102
00:14:27,027 --> 00:14:28,527
It's starting as we speak.

103
00:14:28,603 --> 00:14:31,447
We're going to try to get the others
to reject your offer.

104
00:14:32,213 --> 00:14:35,369
The owners want to reject the offer.

105
00:14:35,371 --> 00:14:39,010
- Can they do that?
- If they convince the majority, yes.

106
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:42,620
Patrick's there already.
You need to try to convince them.

107
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,643
My car's waiting outside.

108
00:14:58,104 --> 00:14:59,768
It's here.
Go to the back entrance.

109
00:15:03,451 --> 00:15:05,803
You're not allowed
into the shareholders meeting.

110
00:15:05,901 --> 00:15:07,526
We can't walk in the front door.

111
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:53,944
Apparently, the meeting
hasn't started yet.

112
00:15:53,977 --> 00:15:55,477
It'll be a couple of minutes.

113
00:16:35,675 --> 00:16:37,590
Did you see those
two men I was talking to?

114
00:16:38,411 --> 00:16:40,888
- Mm-hmm.
- They are the men we need to persuade.

115
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:43,111
They belong to the
anti-Mayers faction.

116
00:16:43,443 --> 00:16:46,661
They claim the Mayers'
management has damaged the business.

117
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:50,161
They hold 7% and 5% respectively.

118
00:16:50,629 --> 00:16:54,348
They can convince the other 39%
to sell to you.

119
00:16:54,935 --> 00:16:57,747
- So we need them on our side.
- Definitely.

120
00:17:08,634 --> 00:17:10,591
Azzurra?

121
00:17:10,593 --> 00:17:13,072
I sent you a message
with the instructions.

122
00:17:15,431 --> 00:17:17,471
Gaetano is coming to get you.

123
00:17:57,336 --> 00:17:59,893
- Haven't they arrived yet?
- No. Did you bring them?

124
00:17:59,895 --> 00:18:02,854
- They're here. Good morning, Alberto.
- Good morning.

125
00:18:07,812 --> 00:18:09,849
- Want a coffee?
- No.

126
00:18:09,851 --> 00:18:11,490
It's disgusting anyway.

127
00:18:18,770 --> 00:18:20,235
- Good afternoon.
- Hello, Leena.

128
00:18:20,282 --> 00:18:21,321
Hello.

129
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:25,216
John Millivan, Bernard Edgewood.

130
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,302
Please, have a seat.

131
00:18:26,321 --> 00:18:29,985
I'd like to present Alberto Resta,
Gennaro Savastano

132
00:18:30,163 --> 00:18:32,343
and Azzurra Avitabile.

133
00:18:32,382 --> 00:18:34,100
- Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure to meet you.

134
00:18:34,763 --> 00:18:35,474
So...

135
00:18:35,959 --> 00:18:37,404
our project...

136
00:18:37,535 --> 00:18:42,473
is to build the biggest airport
ever built on Italian soil.

137
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,841
Yours...

138
00:18:45,398 --> 00:18:49,867
is to get rid of... of the leadership
who doesn't go anywhere.

139
00:18:51,232 --> 00:18:52,396
What do you think about?

140
00:18:56,066 --> 00:18:57,566
Be practical.

141
00:18:59,262 --> 00:19:01,176
We know your business
is in trouble.

142
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:04,071
If you don't close a contract
in the next few months,

143
00:19:04,162 --> 00:19:07,154
you risk going bankrupt
and losing everything.

144
00:19:07,483 --> 00:19:08,795
On the other hand,

145
00:19:08,854 --> 00:19:11,502
we have the opportunity to close
one of the biggest

146
00:19:11,565 --> 00:19:13,775
infrastructure projects in Italy.

147
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,405
But to do so,
we need a company like yours.

148
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:17,973
It's a win-win situation.

149
00:19:18,055 --> 00:19:19,390
You just have to say yes.

150
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,383
And convince your associates...

151
00:19:21,822 --> 00:19:23,775
to accept our offer.

152
00:19:24,952 --> 00:19:26,108
It's not for free...

153
00:19:26,926 --> 00:19:28,035
of course.

154
00:20:00,321 --> 00:20:01,853
I've spoken to the board.

155
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:05,767
You are, now, the majority owner.

156
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,783
They have accepted your bid.

157
00:20:08,909 --> 00:20:11,151
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

158
00:20:11,493 --> 00:20:13,212
- Congratulations, Alberto.
- Thank you.

159
00:20:23,961 --> 00:20:25,880
You're already up?

160
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:29,678
I'll help you.

161
00:20:34,437 --> 00:20:36,676
I'm proud of you, Gennaro.

162
00:20:41,674 --> 00:20:44,073
See you later at the office?

163
00:20:53,749 --> 00:20:55,389
Well?

164
00:20:56,988 --> 00:20:59,827
Good one, Gaetano.
I'll be right down.

165
00:22:15,288 --> 00:22:16,858
Everything is fine.

166
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,973
It's done.

167
00:22:19,036 --> 00:22:20,404
It's real now.

168
00:22:20,663 --> 00:22:24,257
Leena, could you send us all
the documents by mail today please?

169
00:22:24,313 --> 00:22:26,274
We need them for our associates

170
00:22:26,309 --> 00:22:27,231
for a fast check.

171
00:22:27,271 --> 00:22:30,007
- Of course. Leena, you can do that?
- Of course.

172
00:22:30,176 --> 00:22:31,153
Thank you.

173
00:22:44,228 --> 00:22:48,146
Michele. We did it.

174
00:22:49,346 --> 00:22:51,543
The paperwork's on its way to you,

175
00:22:51,545 --> 00:22:55,024
check immediately that it's all okay,
before we go to the notary.

176
00:22:56,463 --> 00:22:58,982
I need to know straightaway.

177
00:23:15,416 --> 00:23:17,493
Thanks.

178
00:23:17,495 --> 00:23:19,015
Cheers!

179
00:23:20,854 --> 00:23:22,891
Check this out, Alberto.

180
00:23:22,893 --> 00:23:26,370
- What is it?
- Dunno.

181
00:23:26,372 --> 00:23:28,331
Looks good, though.

182
00:23:37,328 --> 00:23:38,767
It's Casillo.

183
00:23:39,807 --> 00:23:41,566
Michele.

184
00:23:42,686 --> 00:23:44,325
I can't hear you.

185
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:47,364
Now I can.

186
00:23:53,962 --> 00:23:55,761
What?

187
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:06,437
I'll take care of it now.

188
00:24:08,116 --> 00:24:09,716
What did he say?

189
00:24:12,355 --> 00:24:14,312
There's a document missing,

190
00:24:14,314 --> 00:24:19,190
the banks' approval
for the transfer of ownership.

191
00:24:19,192 --> 00:24:22,709
Wimpro has three lines of credit
with three different banks.

192
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,828
They have to give permission
when ownership changes.

193
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:28,467
But it's a formality,
they must have forgotten.

194
00:24:28,469 --> 00:24:30,708
I'll call Leena,
they'll be at the office.

195
00:24:41,184 --> 00:24:43,421
Her phone's switched off, that's odd.

196
00:24:43,423 --> 00:24:45,580
I'll try Patrick.

197
00:24:45,582 --> 00:24:47,342
Put your shoes on.

198
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,299
Patrick's is switched off, too...

199
00:24:56,618 --> 00:24:59,217
It'll be quicker to go in person.

200
00:25:50,678 --> 00:25:52,557
Be careful, Azzurra.

201
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,857
I called Wimpro's headquarters.

202
00:26:40,859 --> 00:26:45,457
They don't know who we are,
they've never even heard of us.

203
00:26:47,537 --> 00:26:49,896
It was all fake.

204
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:54,012
Gennaro, that's not possible.

205
00:26:54,014 --> 00:26:57,891
I've known Leena for 15 years,
she's always been legit.

206
00:26:57,893 --> 00:27:02,769
I checked her company:
the accounts, acquisitions, contracts.

207
00:27:02,771 --> 00:27:05,370
There has to be another explanation.

208
00:27:11,688 --> 00:27:14,684
There's shit everywhere,

209
00:27:14,686 --> 00:27:17,603
it just has different colors.

210
00:27:17,605 --> 00:27:19,245
There's your explanation.

211
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:33,917
We have two advantages,

212
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:39,315
the first is that they weren't
expecting us to find out so soon,

213
00:27:39,317 --> 00:27:43,516
the second is that I know more
than they think.

214
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:01,547
Gennaro, I swear,

215
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:04,188
I'm not involved.

216
00:28:14,544 --> 00:28:20,460
I know you're not,
but do me a favor.

217
00:28:20,462 --> 00:28:22,381
Whatever you want.

218
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:30,138
From now on, just keep
that fucking mouth of yours shut.

219
00:28:33,177 --> 00:28:34,896
Let's go.

220
00:29:16,329 --> 00:29:18,071
- Hello.
- Hello.

221
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,358
Hello, momma.

222
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,204
I found the Grevillea.

223
00:29:37,036 --> 00:29:38,051
How are you to...

224
00:29:46,295 --> 00:29:47,607
Please don't hurt her.

225
00:29:52,627 --> 00:29:54,426
See, Ma'am? Leena's here.

226
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:56,855
Please.

227
00:29:59,784 --> 00:30:02,863
Only I knew. I could feel it.

228
00:30:06,742 --> 00:30:09,421
That's why I had you followed
the other night.

229
00:30:14,419 --> 00:30:17,378
I've fucking had it with this game!

230
00:30:20,176 --> 00:30:22,613
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

231
00:30:24,478 --> 00:30:27,605
I'm sorry. I'm really...
I'm sorry.

232
00:30:30,093 --> 00:30:33,292
We're all so predictable, so petty.

233
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:42,846
We all have someone important
we'd do anything for,

234
00:30:42,848 --> 00:30:45,167
even something really fucking stupid.

235
00:30:48,486 --> 00:30:51,885
I knew you couldn't leave without
saying goodbye to your mom.

236
00:30:54,324 --> 00:30:56,283
Right, Leena?

237
00:31:03,927 --> 00:31:05,489
Where is my gold?

238
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:09,219
It's...

239
00:31:09,999 --> 00:31:11,436
in the warehouse.

240
00:31:13,094 --> 00:31:14,672
But I don't have a key.

241
00:31:17,784 --> 00:31:19,542
And where is the key?

242
00:31:21,028 --> 00:31:23,614
I don't have it. I don't have it.

243
00:31:25,864 --> 00:31:26,630
No?

244
00:31:27,174 --> 00:31:28,260
Patrick...

245
00:32:15,842 --> 00:32:16,865
Check there.

246
00:33:02,876 --> 00:33:04,875
What the fuck have you done?

247
00:33:08,274 --> 00:33:09,873
Is he dead?

248
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:14,511
- Yes.
- I needed him alive, asshole!

249
00:33:19,190 --> 00:33:21,947
Go and see if anyone's coming.

250
00:33:21,949 --> 00:33:23,588
The piece.

251
00:33:47,429 --> 00:33:49,028
Motherfuckers...

252
00:33:50,587 --> 00:33:53,826
We gotta make him disappear.
Take the arms, hurry.

253
00:34:50,885 --> 00:34:52,924
Our gold is here.

254
00:34:59,841 --> 00:35:02,920
If we hadn't made it in time
tonight it was headed to Singapore.

255
00:35:40,626 --> 00:35:42,185
Come, Gaetano.

256
00:35:51,702 --> 00:35:53,821
See, there's a door.

257
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,859
Is the gold there?

258
00:36:29,488 --> 00:36:33,646
Leena...
Love makes people act crazy.

259
00:36:34,886 --> 00:36:38,002
Now that I've found my gold,
I'm happier,

260
00:36:38,004 --> 00:36:40,681
so I'll give you another chance.

261
00:36:40,683 --> 00:36:42,963
Untie her.

262
00:37:10,552 --> 00:37:13,629
I came to London
because I had a problem

263
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:16,308
and now you have to solve it for me

264
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:18,827
unless you wanna end up
like your friend.

265
00:37:18,829 --> 00:37:22,026
You have 36 hours,
Gaetano will be your shadow.

266
00:37:22,028 --> 00:37:23,467
You understand?

267
00:37:26,586 --> 00:37:28,146
Alberto, come here.

268
00:37:30,625 --> 00:37:32,144
Come here!

269
00:37:41,581 --> 00:37:42,900
Translate.

270
00:37:45,779 --> 00:37:49,258
Come,
let's call them straightaway.

271
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:30,633
Thank you.

272
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,430
Thank you.

273
00:38:48,483 --> 00:38:49,960
Thank you so much.

274
00:39:07,908 --> 00:39:10,387
I really missed
our little lamb chop so much.

275
00:39:11,907 --> 00:39:14,504
I missed him, too.

276
00:39:14,506 --> 00:39:16,665
I really missed
being in my own home.

277
00:39:20,184 --> 00:39:25,022
But now we're back
and we have the company we needed.

278
00:39:32,099 --> 00:39:36,737
In the end, Alberto was right,
Leena was really useful.

279
00:40:18,037 --> 00:40:23,037
