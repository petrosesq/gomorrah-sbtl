00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,950
Thank you.

3
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:46,308
After 30 years
of announcements and empty talk,

4
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,908
this evening we are gathered here
to celebrate among friends,

5
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:54,348
because the second airport hub
for Naples is no longer a dream,

6
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:56,470
it is about to become reality.

7
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,908
Firstly, I'd like to thank our hostess,
a great woman.

8
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:10,468
The woman who currently
leads this consortium,

9
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,190
Ms Tiziana Palumbo.

10
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,668
The hemorrhage has been
completely reabsorbed.

11
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,708
The amniotic sac is intact, blood-flow
velocity is good. You're lucky.

12
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:52,748
You can be returned
to the correctional facility.

13
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,550
All right, sir,
she's coming out now.

14
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:02,030
Mrs Santore, I'll escort you
back to the correctional facility.

15
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:18,708
- What is it?
- The Levantes tried to clip Patrizia.

16
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,388
She's at the hospital.

17
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:22,628
- And how is she?
- I don't know.

18
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,628
But she sent us a message
and a request.

19
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,988
- What message?
- She doesn't want to stay in prison.

20
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,550
But she's only got one way to get out.

21
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,228
Ruggieri. And the request?

22
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,748
She wants to know if she's got
a good friend who can get her out,

23
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,470
because she can't hold out much longer.

24
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,470
Thanks, Fernando.

25
00:03:54,830 --> 00:03:56,630
The baby's all right, yeah?

26
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:03,188
Prison's no place for a woman
in your condition.

27
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:06,630
And who knows
what could happen next time.

28
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:24,950
I want to speak to him.

29
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:49,390
What are you doing in the dark, Gennaro?

30
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,148
How did it go?

31
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,790
Michele says hi.
He dedicated his speech to us.

32
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:09,068
And you? Any news?

33
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,270
Patrizia got the message.

34
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:14,548
And?

35
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,990
She just asked for a lawyer,
she wants the best.

36
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:21,830
We've discussed this already.

37
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,668
You don't need to worry.

38
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,710
Patrizia won't talk.

39
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,748
I'll tell you whatever you want to know,
but I have to get out now.

40
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,788
I'm glad you've taken this decision.

41
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:52,388
But let's make one thing clear:
you're not doing me any favors.

42
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:57,030
I represent the state
and the state has rules and procedures.

43
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:02,388
Firstly, you are obliged
to tell the truth

44
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,668
and we have 120 days to verify

45
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:07,828
whether what you say
is baloney or true.

46
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:11,270
And in those 120 days
your condition can't change.

47
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:15,310
I can't go back to prison.

48
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:24,668
Maybe there is a way.
What do you say, Biagio?

49
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:28,670
A spontaneous statement
that can lead to a sure conviction.

50
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:35,790
Annalisa Maiocca.

51
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:40,590
- Do you know who she is?
- Yes.

52
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:45,310
We know that she's been missing
for almost two years.

53
00:07:48,910 --> 00:07:52,350
She vanished from the face of the earth
because I killed her.

54
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,150
Good morning.

55
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,390
Wait in the car.

56
00:08:26,950 --> 00:08:28,870
- How's Patrizia?
- Pardon?

57
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:36,548
- Have I done something to you?
- You've got the wrong idea.

58
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:38,908
And what's the right idea?

59
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:43,188
I like to win,
I've always been competitive.

60
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,110
Maybe I hoped my father would
come back for a son who's a winner.

61
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,150
My father only ever wanted one thing...

62
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:01,670
for me to be like him.

63
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,550
But I've never been like him.

64
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:12,348
And when I was younger
it made me feel bad.

65
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:14,470
But then you know what I realized?

66
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:21,390
That there are things I can do well....

67
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:26,310
and other things I just can't do.

68
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:30,188
I wouldn't worry too much.

69
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:32,988
From what I know
and from what people tell me about you,

70
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,550
I'm sure your father would be
very proud of you.

71
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:05,588
Good morning, Giancarlo Presti,
court-appointed counsel.

72
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:07,230
Good morning.

73
00:10:15,550 --> 00:10:19,748
Why didn't you include your husband
in the protective measures?

74
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,988
You can save his life.

75
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:26,228
He decided about my life without asking,
the consequences are not my problem.

76
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:29,350
You're about to have a baby,
don't you want him by your side?

77
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,390
He'd need to forget who he was,
break with his family.

78
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,990
Only he can decide if he wants that.

79
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:43,710
- Can we start?
- Sure.

80
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,310
Wait here.

81
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,228
Hi, Uncle.

82
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,868
What brings you here again, Gennaro?

83
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,668
- You know very well.
- You have to tell me.

84
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:15,508
Patrizia will talk.

85
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,468
She hasn't yet,
but I've got to be quick.

86
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,428
And what do you want from me?

87
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,710
I have to free her now, they're holding
her at a secret location.

88
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:27,670
You're the only one who can find her,
and you know it.

89
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:33,668
Unfortunately they've hidden her
too well and no one can find her.

90
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:37,230
And even if I could do it, I wouldn't.

91
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:41,188
I never liked her.

92
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:44,228
But if she talks
it's a problem for you, too.

93
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:46,150
Against us there's only her word.

94
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,108
Maybe it's worth making an effort?

95
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:55,868
The only one shaking things up is her,

96
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,828
and she's one of yours.

97
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:02,148
But before she shook things,
her house got shook up.

98
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:06,070
- And it wasn't me who did that.
- Are you accusing us of something?

99
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:17,068
My father wanted nothing to do with you,

100
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:21,308
he said you've always been
poison for this land

101
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:24,990
and that you would've been ready
to devour him and Secondigliano.

102
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:31,430
Your father had a lot of faults,
but he knew how to see things.

103
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:37,190
You don't. And he knew that too.

104
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:46,630
My father always underestimated me.

105
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:01,268
The youngest in the family is
Francesco Levante, known as Ciccio.

106
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:04,508
You telling me this to get revenge?

107
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:07,590
You asked me what I know,
I know them well.

108
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:14,750
You know him too, don't you?

109
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,630
- You know the answer.
- No, that's not how depositions work.

110
00:13:21,630 --> 00:13:24,070
You need to tell me in your own words.

111
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,070
Welcome, Don Gennaro.

112
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:55,748
I'm still waiting for your answer.

113
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:58,868
Mistral says
he's honored by your offer

114
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:01,708
and we're happy to give you a hand.

115
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,070
In other words, we're at your disposal.

116
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,350
That's what I wanted to hear.

117
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,150
Let's go, guys.

118
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,350
It took a big effort...

119
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:34,870
but in the end we did it.

120
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:41,070
A big effort
and for me it was an honor.

121
00:14:46,310 --> 00:14:47,830
Did something happen?

122
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:57,350
I gotta ask you something important.

123
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:01,950
Something I can only ask a friend.

124
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:06,870
Because that's what you are, Tiziana.
Aren't you?

125
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,830
Yes, I am.

126
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,470
Good.

127
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:26,070
Whatever happens,
from now on, my dream depends on you.

128
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,430
But you must never let me down.

129
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:43,268
Write down whatever
basic needs you have,

130
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,388
I'll see that you get them straightaway.

131
00:16:45,390 --> 00:16:48,190
You'll find a change of clothes
in the closet.

132
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:53,190
For anything, we're here.

133
00:17:16,830 --> 00:17:18,590
Gennaro, are you ready?

134
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,708
- Are you all right?
- Sure.

135
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,150
Then let's go.

136
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,710
You're so beautiful.

137
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,510
When you married me you gave me
the most beautiful gift in the world.

138
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:13,748
I tried to be the man you deserved,
the father you wanted for Pietro.

139
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,510
And you succeeded.

140
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:20,990
I don't know, but I tried.

141
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:23,870
I tried very hard.

142
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:30,348
I did it for you two
and for my brother Ciro,

143
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:32,390
who died to leave us with his dream.

144
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:41,350
But in this new life
I felt a battle inside me.

145
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:45,228
And what I was before began pounding,

146
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:47,150
wanting to get out again.

147
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:52,270
It hasn't come out, though.

148
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,188
Remember one thing.

149
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:07,750
What, Gennaro?

150
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:12,268
All the dreams we have for Pietro

151
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:14,710
will come true, I promise you.

152
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:26,230
And the battle?

153
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:40,230
The battle's over.

154
00:21:27,115 --> 00:21:29,713
I heard about your brother.

155
00:21:29,715 --> 00:21:32,553
The peace you sold us was bullshit.

156
00:21:32,555 --> 00:21:34,675
Peace doesn't kill people.

157
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,555
But it's not made for people like us.

158
00:21:43,395 --> 00:21:45,555
Did you bring my friend?

159
00:21:50,795 --> 00:21:53,793
And where's my present?

160
00:21:53,795 --> 00:21:56,195
You'll get it before I leave here.

161
00:22:25,955 --> 00:22:28,275
Patrizia asked me to help her escape.

162
00:22:30,235 --> 00:22:32,595
And why did she ask you and not me?

163
00:22:33,955 --> 00:22:35,435
Do I have to explain it?

164
00:22:38,355 --> 00:22:40,515
Anyway, I can't do it alone.

165
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:44,195
You know what it means?

166
00:22:46,315 --> 00:22:50,275
You got one last chance to show
your wife what side you're on.

167
00:22:52,635 --> 00:22:54,555
And what do I have to do?

168
00:22:56,755 --> 00:22:59,995
You gotta help me find out
where the cops have taken her.

169
00:23:02,835 --> 00:23:04,435
And after that?

170
00:23:06,075 --> 00:23:09,075
After that you gotta tell the Graduate
where Enzo's hiding.

171
00:23:42,035 --> 00:23:44,435
Pure'n'Simple, what's going on?

172
00:23:49,755 --> 00:23:51,235
Enzo, wait!

173
00:23:52,395 --> 00:23:55,033
Trust me, listen to him.

174
00:23:55,035 --> 00:23:58,353
And what can a rat tell me?

175
00:23:58,355 --> 00:24:00,393
The Graduate's on the move.

176
00:24:00,395 --> 00:24:03,073
He called all his men,
but he didn't tell us anything.

177
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:05,433
And so?

178
00:24:05,435 --> 00:24:10,073
I think they're coming after you,
they know where you are.

179
00:24:10,075 --> 00:24:13,633
- Why you telling me this?
- 'Cause I made a mistake.

180
00:24:13,635 --> 00:24:15,715
And I also want to be forgiven.

181
00:25:31,795 --> 00:25:36,313
Don't move, you pieces of shit.

182
00:25:36,315 --> 00:25:38,195
What the fuck are you doing?

183
00:25:54,795 --> 00:25:56,715
Where's Enzo?

184
00:25:58,075 --> 00:26:01,755
I don't know.
I haven't seen him for days.

185
00:27:12,475 --> 00:27:13,875
Enzo...

186
00:27:22,835 --> 00:27:24,633
Enzo, we gotta go.

187
00:27:24,635 --> 00:27:26,513
We gotta go!

188
00:27:26,515 --> 00:27:28,915
Enzo...

189
00:27:30,075 --> 00:27:33,435
We gotta go. Guys, we gotta go!

190
00:27:55,515 --> 00:27:57,475
Sorry I'm late.

191
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:17,675
- It was you who got Patrizia arrested.
- Yes.

192
00:28:19,755 --> 00:28:21,755
Why did you do it?

193
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:27,395
- You didn't leave me any choice.
- You had a choice, Michelangelo.

194
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:31,155
And you didn't choose us.

195
00:28:35,715 --> 00:28:38,875
That's why you're nothing to us anymore.

196
00:28:41,995 --> 00:28:44,675
Excuse me, Dad.

197
00:28:57,355 --> 00:28:59,555
I came to say goodbye.

198
00:29:00,555 --> 00:29:03,113
But first I wanted to thank you, Dad,

199
00:29:03,115 --> 00:29:07,753
because if family's
the most important thing for me,

200
00:29:07,755 --> 00:29:10,433
it's because you taught me that.

201
00:29:10,435 --> 00:29:12,513
As far as I can see,
you didn't learn it very well.

202
00:29:12,515 --> 00:29:14,715
You're wrong.

203
00:29:16,315 --> 00:29:18,595
You and I are more similar
than you think.

204
00:29:25,355 --> 00:29:27,115
Goodbye, Mom.

205
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:51,795
Just a moment.

206
00:30:04,715 --> 00:30:06,275
Come in.

207
00:30:12,875 --> 00:30:17,435
We've been informed
your husband wishes to collaborate.

208
00:30:20,155 --> 00:30:23,113
- And they're bringing him here?
- Exactly.

209
00:30:23,115 --> 00:30:25,753
Ruggieri says that as soon as
you finish the depositions,

210
00:30:25,755 --> 00:30:30,155
you'll sign the statement and you'll
have new identities and residence.

211
00:30:32,355 --> 00:30:33,875
Thank you.

212
00:30:52,115 --> 00:30:57,715
I wanna kill that filthy bitch
with my own two hands!

213
00:31:01,835 --> 00:31:03,555
What the fuck's going on?

214
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:19,595
Take a message to your brothers.

215
00:32:20,955 --> 00:32:23,115
Gennaro Savastano is back.

216
00:32:58,795 --> 00:33:00,115
Yes.

217
00:33:26,355 --> 00:33:28,393
We gotta go,

218
00:33:28,395 --> 00:33:31,833
for anything you need
my colleagues are here.

219
00:33:31,835 --> 00:33:34,595
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

220
00:33:39,675 --> 00:33:41,595
How are you both?

221
00:33:43,795 --> 00:33:45,475
Good.

222
00:33:47,355 --> 00:33:50,755
The second escort has left.

223
00:33:51,835 --> 00:33:53,675
Let's roll.

224
00:36:26,355 --> 00:36:27,955
Thank you, Gennaro.

225
00:36:30,235 --> 00:36:33,353
- Is it for us?
- Yes.

226
00:36:33,355 --> 00:36:35,193
Where's it going?

227
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:38,395
Faraway, that way we'll all be safer.

228
00:36:43,875 --> 00:36:47,635
- Patrizia, can I have a word?
- Of course.

229
00:36:49,435 --> 00:36:51,235
See you up there.

230
00:36:59,835 --> 00:37:01,635
Goodbye, Gennaro.

231
00:37:02,715 --> 00:37:04,555
Goodbye, Michelangelo.

232
00:37:27,795 --> 00:37:29,115
Well?

233
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:36,515
- This is your dream?
- It was.

234
00:37:38,995 --> 00:37:42,475
The truth is, for people like us
dreams don't exist.

235
00:37:44,835 --> 00:37:46,835
What will you do now?

236
00:37:47,835 --> 00:37:50,715
Tally up who are friends
and who are enemies.

237
00:37:51,995 --> 00:37:54,993
I gotta make up for all my mistakes.

238
00:37:54,995 --> 00:37:58,235
You made a big one: Gerlando.

239
00:37:59,875 --> 00:38:02,115
I've already taken care of it.

240
00:38:04,235 --> 00:38:07,313
The next one is the prosecutor.

241
00:38:07,315 --> 00:38:10,873
- What did you tell him?
- I talked about myself.

242
00:38:10,875 --> 00:38:12,995
Didn't he ask you about me?

243
00:38:14,315 --> 00:38:15,875
No, he didn't ask me anything.

244
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:27,715
Help me to believe you, Patrizia.

245
00:38:31,155 --> 00:38:33,273
You know my story.

246
00:38:33,275 --> 00:38:36,953
You know where I come from,
I never asked anybody for anything.

247
00:38:36,955 --> 00:38:40,595
I never kneeled down
and I don't want to start now.

248
00:38:44,035 --> 00:38:47,233
I'd never betray you and you know it.

249
00:38:47,235 --> 00:38:49,833
You feel it inside.

250
00:38:49,835 --> 00:38:51,595
That should be enough.

251
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:09,755
Remember when I told you
never to trust anyone?

252
00:39:13,955 --> 00:39:17,235
I never told you not to trust me either.

253
00:39:40,955 --> 00:39:42,515
Is this it, Gennaro?

254
00:39:44,195 --> 00:39:46,195
This is it, Patrizia.

255
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,635
Don Gennaro, come with me.

256
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:10,208
