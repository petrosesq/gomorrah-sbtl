00:02:13,215 --> 00:02:16,215
- The shipment's past Rome.
- Call me when it arrives.

3
00:03:09,135 --> 00:03:11,575
You're late, it's nearly over.

4
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,733
I ran into traffic.

5
00:03:15,735 --> 00:03:18,213
In Heaven as it is on earth.

6
00:03:18,215 --> 00:03:21,653
Give us this day our daily bread,

7
00:03:21,655 --> 00:03:24,373
forgive us our trespasses

8
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:27,533
as we give those
who trespass against us

9
00:03:27,535 --> 00:03:31,375
and lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.

10
00:03:32,975 --> 00:03:36,933
Deliver us, Lord, from every evil,
graciously grant peace in our days,

11
00:03:36,935 --> 00:03:39,533
that, by the help of your mercy,

12
00:03:39,535 --> 00:03:43,053
we may be always free from sin
and safe from all distress,

13
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:48,093
as we await the blessed hope and
the coming of our Savior, Jesus Christ.

14
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:52,453
For the kingdom, the power and the glory
are yours, now and for ever.

15
00:03:52,455 --> 00:03:55,013
The peace of the Lord
be with you always.

16
00:03:55,015 --> 00:03:56,653
And with your spirit.

17
00:03:56,655 --> 00:04:00,895
In the spirit of Christ risen,
exchange a sign of peace.

18
00:04:02,095 --> 00:04:04,295
Peace.

19
00:04:07,215 --> 00:04:09,655
Peace be with you.

20
00:04:12,575 --> 00:04:14,015
Peace.

21
00:05:17,095 --> 00:05:21,173
Good morning!
Good morning, Grandma!

22
00:05:21,175 --> 00:05:22,853
Everything all right?

23
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:25,693
You grow more beautiful every day!
Cutie-pie.

24
00:05:25,695 --> 00:05:27,213
- Michelangelo!
- Aunty!

25
00:05:27,215 --> 00:05:30,253
- I made pasta for you.
- Do you remember Patrizia?

26
00:05:30,255 --> 00:05:32,333
- Of course!
- She's joining us today.

27
00:05:32,335 --> 00:05:34,093
I'll take care of it.

28
00:05:34,095 --> 00:05:36,333
Michelangelo,
come with me to buy dessert.

29
00:05:36,335 --> 00:05:38,853
- Wait, Ciccio.
- We'll be back in ten minutes.

30
00:05:38,855 --> 00:05:40,855
- Wait!
- Come with me.

31
00:05:41,855 --> 00:05:43,375
I'll be right back.

32
00:05:45,695 --> 00:05:48,173
Give them to me, I'll cut them.

33
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:51,695
Donna Patrizia, give me your jacket.

34
00:06:00,255 --> 00:06:02,055
You don't know how to do it.

35
00:06:05,455 --> 00:06:08,493
I'll do it with mozzarella.

36
00:06:08,495 --> 00:06:12,215
- Can I help?
- There's no need, thank you.

37
00:06:25,055 --> 00:06:28,093
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

38
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:31,215
In church I saw
you didn't take part in the prayer.

39
00:06:32,855 --> 00:06:34,335
Don't you have faith?

40
00:06:35,655 --> 00:06:39,213
I lost both my parents
when I was only 12 years old.

41
00:06:39,215 --> 00:06:43,333
I was left with my three-year-old
brother and two younger sisters.

42
00:06:43,335 --> 00:06:47,015
From then on, for me
the Almighty has only been a fantasy.

43
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:52,535
The Almighty tests our faith
through pain.

44
00:07:00,935 --> 00:07:03,855
The priest who buried Mamma
said God is love.

45
00:07:05,415 --> 00:07:08,775
That's right, God is love.

46
00:08:05,175 --> 00:08:06,535
Nicola.

47
00:08:08,895 --> 00:08:10,895
Where are we meeting?

48
00:08:12,255 --> 00:08:14,695
Okay, got it, I'll come by later.

49
00:08:29,015 --> 00:08:30,855
Can I have a word?

50
00:08:38,455 --> 00:08:40,295
At your disposal.

51
00:08:41,855 --> 00:08:44,975
I raised my Michelangelo like a prince.

52
00:08:45,975 --> 00:08:50,493
I sent him to school,
he's educated.

53
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:52,535
He speaks proper Italian.

54
00:08:53,535 --> 00:08:55,975
Michelangelo is special to me.

55
00:08:57,095 --> 00:09:00,973
He told us you're seeing
a lot of each other

56
00:09:00,975 --> 00:09:04,215
and for matters
that don't concern our business.

57
00:09:05,935 --> 00:09:09,093
You're the boss of Secondigliano
and we respect you,

58
00:09:09,095 --> 00:09:14,133
basically because the person
who put you there is one of us.

59
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:18,095
But we don't want our blood
mixing with yours.

60
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,733
If you please,

61
00:09:25,735 --> 00:09:27,575
let's go eat.

62
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,215
I want to say something.

63
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,613
If Patrizia is here,
there's a reason for it.

64
00:12:09,615 --> 00:12:12,413
- I want to tell you that she and I...
- What do you want to say?

65
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:16,493
What does he want to say?
What's going on, Mickey?

66
00:12:16,495 --> 00:12:20,413
Nothing, absolutely nothing's going on.

67
00:12:20,415 --> 00:12:22,973
Don't worry, Donna Benedetta.

68
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:26,533
If I'm here today it's because
a new shipment has arrived.

69
00:12:26,535 --> 00:12:30,373
If it's all right with you,
tonight we'll organize the delivery.

70
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:34,095
- The sooner the better.
- Then that's settled.

71
00:12:35,535 --> 00:12:38,095
Thank you so much,
it was all delicious.

72
00:12:39,975 --> 00:12:41,815
But I have to go.

73
00:12:46,775 --> 00:12:49,373
- Why?
- Because it's only right.

74
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,415
It's right for you, not for me!

75
00:12:52,655 --> 00:12:54,775
Mickey, wait a minute.

76
00:13:02,135 --> 00:13:03,895
Patrizia!

77
00:13:07,735 --> 00:13:09,735
Where are you going? Stop!

78
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,413
- Stop! Get out.
- I haven't got time for this bullshit.

79
00:13:14,415 --> 00:13:18,335
Is it bullshit?
If it's bullshit run me down. Get out!

80
00:13:25,535 --> 00:13:28,893
I couldn't give a fuck
about what my family said.

81
00:13:28,895 --> 00:13:31,653
They're your blood.

82
00:13:31,655 --> 00:13:34,215
No one can go against their own blood.

83
00:13:35,535 --> 00:13:38,813
I learned that the hard way.

84
00:13:38,815 --> 00:13:41,215
That's just the way it is, Michelangelo.

85
00:15:48,255 --> 00:15:51,093
Guys, run! The cops!

86
00:15:51,095 --> 00:15:52,415
Tell the others!

87
00:15:59,735 --> 00:16:01,293
Lino!

88
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:05,335
- Nicola!
- Lino, run!

89
00:16:12,335 --> 00:16:15,173
- The cops!
- Run!

90
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:17,255
Get in!

91
00:16:20,535 --> 00:16:23,975
- Stop, police!
- Against the wall!

92
00:16:27,455 --> 00:16:29,255
Go!

93
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:45,575
Don't move! Face on the ground!

94
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:33,973
I don't know how it happened.

95
00:17:33,975 --> 00:17:37,013
The cops suddenly showed up.

96
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,655
- Right, Lino?
- That's right.

97
00:17:47,055 --> 00:17:50,613
The guys are trusted soldiers,

98
00:17:50,615 --> 00:17:53,735
they've worked with us
on every shipment.

99
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,535
What do you think of me, Nicola?

100
00:18:04,215 --> 00:18:07,095
I've demonstrated what I think of you
with my actions.

101
00:18:09,975 --> 00:18:13,693
This raid is a fucking big problem

102
00:18:13,695 --> 00:18:16,215
and takes priority over everything.

103
00:18:19,415 --> 00:18:21,373
What do we do?

104
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:23,493
Call a meeting.

105
00:18:23,495 --> 00:18:27,535
I want the whole Alliance there,
I wanna see if one of them's involved.

106
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,775
Donna Patrizia...

107
00:19:33,855 --> 00:19:37,175
They ripped off the drugs
we paid for upfront?

108
00:19:38,415 --> 00:19:41,693
The problem's not just the money
we paid upfront,

109
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:47,453
if there's no drugs to sell,
the dealing will stop.

110
00:19:47,455 --> 00:19:49,895
The dealing won't stop.

111
00:19:51,415 --> 00:19:54,375
- We'll sell hashish, pills.
- Pills?

112
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:58,653
- Are we 15?
- We all have to suffer.

113
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:01,255
The time it takes for another shipment.

114
00:20:02,775 --> 00:20:04,775
So, tell me something.

115
00:20:07,935 --> 00:20:11,055
Who's going to pay
for this new shipment?

116
00:20:14,215 --> 00:20:17,893
This Alliance is based
on the rules we all agreed to.

117
00:20:17,895 --> 00:20:20,295
The shipment was my responsibility.

118
00:20:21,935 --> 00:20:24,653
I'll pay for it.

119
00:20:24,655 --> 00:20:26,855
And how long will it take?

120
00:20:29,135 --> 00:20:32,213
- A month.
- That seems too long.

121
00:20:32,215 --> 00:20:36,375
This raid was bad for all of us.

122
00:20:37,775 --> 00:20:39,895
For us the same as you.

123
00:20:42,735 --> 00:20:45,895
But if you give us what we lost
we'll be square.

124
00:20:47,535 --> 00:20:49,695
But a month means a month.

125
00:20:54,975 --> 00:20:56,735
You have my word.

126
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:00,375
That's good enough for us.

127
00:21:03,935 --> 00:21:05,975
Good enough for us, too.

128
00:21:49,255 --> 00:21:51,133
You got a problem?

129
00:21:51,135 --> 00:21:54,693
Tell her we want
to talk to her, alone.

130
00:21:54,695 --> 00:21:56,415
All good.

131
00:22:16,895 --> 00:22:19,213
They're not happy?

132
00:22:19,215 --> 00:22:22,893
They want to talk to you
without people around.

133
00:22:22,895 --> 00:22:25,255
We gotta take 'em out straightaway.

134
00:22:28,215 --> 00:22:30,775
I'll decide what we do.

135
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,518
Good morning.

136
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,998
- Hello, Donna Patrizia.
- Good morning.

137
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,120
Well? What do we need to talk about?

138
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,078
What you said doesn't sit right with us.

139
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,438
Till yesterday
the Forcella guys were small fry.

140
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,958
The Levantes have a finger in every
fucking pie, government contracts...

141
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,918
Drugs are chump change for them.

142
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:22,398
But we live off drugs
and we can't afford to lose a month.

143
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,480
We found another channel.

144
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,200
We all get coke through
the same channel, that's the deal.

145
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,758
Or am I wrong?

146
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,640
You're not wrong
but our people are starving.

147
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,518
And if they turn on us there won't be
any more deals with anyone.

148
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,478
You understand...

149
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,558
I understand that you're being
disrespectful to me.

150
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:54,078
You can understand what you want,

151
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,440
but you have to give us our money now.

152
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,278
We'll wait until next Sunday.

153
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,920
You have one week,
then we'll go through other channels.

154
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:10,240
That's it, then.

155
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,120
50 thousand.

156
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,520
We're 500 thousand short.

157
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,240
- Have we looked everywhere?
- There's nothing left.

158
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,160
Go away.

159
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:19,360
I said go away!

160
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,720
You know what I'm doing
and what the drug money is for.

161
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,560
I put you in Secondigliano so
I didn't have to bother about this shit.

162
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,840
I don't know who,
but someone wants to screw me.

163
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,720
What did you expect?

164
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,960
This is what it means to be a boss.

165
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,560
This is our life.

166
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,480
Few friends and snakes everywhere.

167
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:55,520
The Capaccios can't wait
to break this alliance

168
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,758
and I can't afford
any trouble right now.

169
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,840
We have to do what they want.

170
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,000
I'll give you the money for
the shipment, but it's the last time.

171
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,080
Thank you, Gennaro.

172
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,360
Patrizia...

173
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,360
Bring me the name of who did it.

174
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:03,038
What are you doing here?

175
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,838
Don Michelangelo Levante's inside,

176
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,960
he says he wants to talk to you.

177
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,798
- What do you want?
- I heard you have a problem.

178
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,958
- I want to help you.
- I don't need it.

179
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,838
Go home, or your father will be worried.

180
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:47,520
Still on about my father?

181
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:53,238
You know what I think? The problem's
not the crap my father says.

182
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:56,398
- What is it, then?
- You don't have any balls.

183
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:01,158
I'm tired, I can't even listen to you.
Let go of me.

184
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:06,838
I went against my whole family for you.
I'm still here.

185
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,598
And what did you do?

186
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,520
You ran away.

187
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:16,720
You know what I think, how I feel.

188
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,200
You know all too well.

189
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:24,558
But this is the last time I'm saying it.

190
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,240
If you want me, you make the next move.

191
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,838
Well?

192
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,478
Have you taken care of that matter?

193
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,840
Alberto, maybe I wasn't clear,
I need this money now.

194
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,920
And I mean now.

195
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,720
Don't worry, we'll fix it all up later.

196
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,600
All right.

197
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,280
What's going on?

198
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,518
Nothing, baby, it's all good.

199
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,198
You said that in London, too.

200
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:46,118
It's always all good.

201
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:51,838
Gennaro...
we made a promise, you and me,

202
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,240
that we're always together in this.

203
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,318
It's better
if I'm on my own for certain things.

204
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,800
Don't treat me like I'm dumb!

205
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,600
They fucked off with the shipment, okay?

206
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,358
And I have to fix it
or else the peace is gone.

207
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:32,318
And we can flush everything
we've done down the shitter!

208
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,878
Who told you? Patrizia?

209
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,318
Was it her calling you?
Why didn't you tell me, asshole?

210
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,838
What the fuck's that got to do with it?

211
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,520
I gotta help her and I gotta do it
for us, you know that!

212
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,800
I know.

213
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,400
But I'm with you.

214
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:57,320
And you mustn't hide
anything from me anymore.

215
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,520
What you're looking for is in there.

216
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,840
But it's not a gift.

217
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,078
I know it's not a gift.

218
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,760
Tell Gennaro I'll give it back
in two months.

219
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,200
You used to work in a place like this,
didn't you?

220
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:05,798
Patrizia...

221
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:09,038
I wanted to tell you personally

222
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,040
how far this collaboration is taking us.

223
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:15,400
That's very important.

224
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,640
Me and Gennaro still
have a lot of faith in you.

225
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:26,960
And I paid a heavy price to earn it.

226
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,600
That's true.

227
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,718
You've done a lot for us.

228
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,040
And I won't forget it.

229
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,200
But don't think you're the only one
who's lost something.

230
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,320
Don't worry.

231
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:08,080
I won't forget it.

232
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,640
You can go now.

233
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,958
Take it to them now.

234
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:53,838
Tell the Capaccios
they got what they asked for.

235
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,678
You want us to come with you?

236
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:59,760
No, I need to sort something out
on my own.

237
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,600
Donna Patrizia, good evening.

238
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,880
To what do we owe the pleasure
of this unexpected visit?

239
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,798
Care to come in? A drink perhaps?

240
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,840
Don't bother, Papa.

241
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,320
I just want to say something.

242
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,400
Go ahead.

243
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,838
The other day you said something to me

244
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,920
and I didn't say anything back.

245
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,000
Maybe you think I ran away.

246
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:04,960
If you do, you're wrong.
What you said offended me.

247
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,920
And that's no good.

248
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:15,278
On the other hand, as you know,

249
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,318
the basis for respect is sincerity.

250
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,000
Or am I wrong?

251
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,320
You're not wrong.

252
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,358
Then there's something
you need to know.

253
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,720
The problem isn't whether or not
I'm right for your son.

254
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,880
We've already made our choice.

255
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,080
The problem is you.

256
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,200
We're serious about each other.

257
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,198
Is that all?

258
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:10,800
That's all.

259
00:41:01,421 --> 00:41:06,421
