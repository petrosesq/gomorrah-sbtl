00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:53,908
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mayor.

3
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,348
- Good morning, Corrado.
- A coffee?

4
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,108
Good morning, Mayor.

5
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:02,028
Mayor, about my nephew's situation...

6
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:05,787
We made a call,
the time it takes and we'll fix it.

7
00:05:05,789 --> 00:05:07,427
Thanks for everything.

8
00:05:07,429 --> 00:05:09,469
- You're welcome, Mayor.
- Thank you, Corrado.

9
00:05:12,429 --> 00:05:14,309
Have a nice day.

10
00:05:37,827 --> 00:05:40,545
- What's going on?
- Dad wants to talk to you.

11
00:05:40,547 --> 00:05:42,146
- Now?
- Yes.

12
00:05:43,906 --> 00:05:45,384
Where are you going?

13
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:48,066
Get in my car,
I'll bring you back later.

14
00:06:19,663 --> 00:06:21,741
<i>Sunshine is predicted for this week,</i>

15
00:06:21,743 --> 00:06:26,543
<i>with spikes in humidity
and moderate winds.</i>

16
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:50,099
What's going on, Gerlando?

17
00:06:50,101 --> 00:06:53,139
I have a council meeting this morning,
is this any way to behave?

18
00:06:53,141 --> 00:06:56,298
You're making me look like shit
with the clinic.

19
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,618
No one's fault but your own.

20
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,658
You bit off more than you can chew
and you want to rush things.

21
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,178
I bought you two thousand votes.

22
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,817
The citizens went to vote,
I paid them 50 euros each.

23
00:07:09,819 --> 00:07:12,577
So I paid for nothing?

24
00:07:12,579 --> 00:07:15,857
You're right,
but we're in a democracy.

25
00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:18,336
There are laws, the prefect,

26
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:21,696
newspapers, the opposition,
public opinion.

27
00:07:21,698 --> 00:07:23,896
Someone always wants
to show who's in charge.

28
00:07:23,898 --> 00:07:27,858
You were a nobody and now
for everyone you're "the mayor".

29
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:31,735
You know why we got you elected?

30
00:07:31,737 --> 00:07:35,695
Because now
we enter your offices as we please,

31
00:07:35,697 --> 00:07:37,337
like bosses.

32
00:07:38,537 --> 00:07:43,294
If things aren't like that anymore,
we'll have to change, my dear Antonio.

33
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,136
It means we backed
the wrong person.

34
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:55,613
You think you can do
what you want, don't you?

35
00:07:55,615 --> 00:07:59,493
But have you thought this through?
People like me in this town.

36
00:07:59,495 --> 00:08:01,453
Good for you!

37
00:08:01,455 --> 00:08:04,853
- Do you want to do things or not?
- I do what I can.

38
00:08:04,855 --> 00:08:07,454
You have my word. But it's not easy.

39
00:08:09,134 --> 00:08:12,094
Go. May the Holy Virgin be with you.

40
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:21,133
- Goodbye, Gerlando.
- Take care.

41
00:08:41,132 --> 00:08:43,289
Take him to the quarry.

42
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:46,329
Saro's there, too.

43
00:08:46,331 --> 00:08:48,211
And fix him up good.

44
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:57,290
My beauty! Have I fed you?

45
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:02,088
And have you got water?

46
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:04,490
You're all dirty,
we gotta clean up here.

47
00:11:26,518 --> 00:11:28,638
<i>Felice!</i>

48
00:11:31,197 --> 00:11:33,397
<i>Felice, come here a moment.</i>

49
00:11:34,957 --> 00:11:41,077
<i>I got a nice present for you. Come.</i>

50
00:11:43,076 --> 00:11:46,354
<i>Felice, I wanted to introduce you
to Gennaro Savastano.</i>

51
00:11:46,356 --> 00:11:49,234
- <i>Kill him!</i>
- <i>What the fuck you talking about?</i>

52
00:11:49,236 --> 00:11:51,274
<i>Shut up, it won't take long.</i>

53
00:11:51,276 --> 00:11:54,995
<i>I didn't do anything, guys!</i>

54
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,315
<i>Shoot!</i>

55
00:11:59,755 --> 00:12:01,435
<i>Go!</i>

56
00:12:04,395 --> 00:12:06,874
<i>Go, Gennaro!</i>

57
00:12:09,754 --> 00:12:12,552
<i>You gotta finish now, Gennaro!</i>

58
00:12:12,554 --> 00:12:14,074
<i>And go!</i>

59
00:13:24,268 --> 00:13:25,908
What happened?

60
00:13:30,947 --> 00:13:32,667
Ciro's dead.

61
00:13:39,787 --> 00:13:41,866
He died to protect me...

62
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,306
Us.

63
00:13:49,586 --> 00:13:51,506
Now we're alone.

64
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,065
We've always been alone, Gennaro.

65
00:14:01,145 --> 00:14:02,945
Always.

66
00:14:04,585 --> 00:14:09,904
But you're Gennaro Savastano,
don't you ever forget that.

67
00:14:20,743 --> 00:14:23,221
Guys, what the fuck happened?

68
00:14:23,223 --> 00:14:26,501
We've fucking had it
with being billiard balls.

69
00:14:26,503 --> 00:14:29,500
From now on, we're like Switzerland.

70
00:14:29,502 --> 00:14:32,142
Nice place, Switzerland, huh?

71
00:14:33,462 --> 00:14:35,182
But it's 800km from Naples.

72
00:14:44,621 --> 00:14:48,619
If you make us fight a war
we don't want to,

73
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,981
you'll have a problem in Central Naples.

74
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,578
But if we leave with a handshake,

75
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:03,540
no one will come and give you shit
in your neighborhood.

76
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:08,217
You have one enemy less.

77
00:15:08,219 --> 00:15:09,859
Think about it.

78
00:15:47,136 --> 00:15:48,936
Good morning.

79
00:15:59,015 --> 00:16:01,695
As you all know, the Wizard's dead.

80
00:16:05,174 --> 00:16:08,174
Now the Sanità and Maddalena areas
are under our control.

81
00:16:09,734 --> 00:16:12,534
For those who want to work with us,
our door is always open.

82
00:16:14,214 --> 00:16:18,651
As far as the money is concerned,
there's 20% more for everyone.

83
00:16:18,653 --> 00:16:20,613
But you gotta earn it.

84
00:16:23,173 --> 00:16:26,773
We gotta wipe Gennaro Savastano
from the face of the earth.

85
00:17:57,365 --> 00:17:58,805
Stop.

86
00:18:19,523 --> 00:18:23,283
I'd like to keep buying the stuff
from you, at the same price.

87
00:18:25,923 --> 00:18:28,881
Between you and me it's just business.

88
00:18:28,883 --> 00:18:31,202
I think alliances are bullshit.

89
00:18:32,482 --> 00:18:36,440
You hold one hand out
and hide a gun with the other.

90
00:18:36,442 --> 00:18:38,402
We're out.

91
00:18:46,561 --> 00:18:48,001
Is it here?

92
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,480
It's here.

93
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:32,197
I'm cool with everything you said.

94
00:19:37,197 --> 00:19:39,597
But I swear in front of my brother...

95
00:19:42,116 --> 00:19:45,996
I'll never forget
what you made me do on that boat.

96
00:19:55,275 --> 00:19:59,195
When you kill someone you care about,
you kill yourself.

97
00:20:02,395 --> 00:20:04,675
I'm not looking for your forgiveness...

98
00:20:07,674 --> 00:20:09,514
...but mine.

99
00:20:30,232 --> 00:20:34,270
- What do you want?
- Easy, old man. Where's the cage?

100
00:20:34,272 --> 00:20:36,630
It's back here, but don't kill me.

101
00:20:36,632 --> 00:20:40,232
- Hurry up!
- It's here.

102
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:48,471
That's from a true gentleman,
I wouldn't have even given you 20 euros.

103
00:21:41,626 --> 00:21:43,546
- Hi, Gennaro.
- Hi, Patrizia.

104
00:21:45,226 --> 00:21:46,786
C'mon, guys.

105
00:21:54,745 --> 00:21:56,865
Guys, the situation's not good.

106
00:21:58,265 --> 00:22:01,465
- The Capaccios want war.
- We gotta kill 'em all.

107
00:22:05,064 --> 00:22:06,504
No.

108
00:22:08,904 --> 00:22:11,982
You gotta keep calm until I tell you.

109
00:22:11,984 --> 00:22:13,942
Stay with your families,

110
00:22:13,944 --> 00:22:17,703
if anyone asks where you were
they can back you up.

111
00:22:19,143 --> 00:22:20,583
Why?

112
00:22:24,583 --> 00:22:29,702
Because I'm gonna make it rain blood
and I don't want you to get wet.

113
00:22:31,342 --> 00:22:32,822
Is that clear?

114
00:22:36,102 --> 00:22:38,260
He's right.

115
00:22:38,262 --> 00:22:39,862
That's all.

116
00:22:41,261 --> 00:22:43,021
Let's go, Patrizia.

117
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,900
Gennaro.

118
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,778
If our people know it's gonna rain

119
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,659
they won't wanna stay
underwater doing nothing.

120
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:09,897
You need to tell them
what you got in mind.

121
00:23:09,899 --> 00:23:12,099
For now only you and me
need to know.

122
00:23:15,819 --> 00:23:17,856
Never forget one thing,

123
00:23:17,858 --> 00:23:19,696
he who commands is like a father,

124
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:23,818
he doesn't need to explain the problem
to his kids, he has to fix it.

125
00:23:27,818 --> 00:23:29,737
Put it in the back.

126
00:23:38,537 --> 00:23:40,575
- Did you pay?
- Yeah, but didn't need to.

127
00:23:40,577 --> 00:23:44,136
Asshole, you can't steal Christ's Tears.

128
00:24:06,214 --> 00:24:11,812
It was a goldfinch that took the thorns
from Jesus' forehead when he died.

129
00:24:11,814 --> 00:24:14,854
And so a drop of blood
stained its forehead.

130
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:22,213
It was as rare as this one,
and like this one it was special.

131
00:24:23,893 --> 00:24:26,651
What's special about it?

132
00:24:26,653 --> 00:24:29,372
They call it a "color bearer",
it's very rare.

133
00:24:32,252 --> 00:24:36,210
- It doesn't have any color.
- He'll pass it down to his offspring.

134
00:24:36,212 --> 00:24:38,572
That's why he's so special.

135
00:25:47,366 --> 00:25:48,886
Good morning, Don Savastano.

136
00:26:17,123 --> 00:26:21,161
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with Thee.

137
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:23,481
Blessed art Thou among women

138
00:26:23,483 --> 00:26:26,361
and blessed is the fruit
of Thy womb, Jesus.

139
00:26:26,363 --> 00:26:31,040
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners,

140
00:26:31,042 --> 00:26:34,400
now and at the hour of our death.

141
00:26:34,402 --> 00:26:39,082
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

142
00:26:41,881 --> 00:26:44,081
Hi, Uncle.

143
00:26:51,841 --> 00:26:53,320
Gennaro.

144
00:26:56,360 --> 00:27:00,198
- How long's it been?
- A long time.

145
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,637
It definitely wasn't because of me,
it was your father.

146
00:27:04,639 --> 00:27:09,719
He said he didn't want to be with us,
it was better that way for his family.

147
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,918
I saw my wife cry a lot
when they killed your mother.

148
00:27:18,758 --> 00:27:20,998
Is that how he protected her?

149
00:27:25,118 --> 00:27:30,717
My father paid for what he did
and now he's resting in peace with Mom.

150
00:27:32,477 --> 00:27:36,077
But we're still here,
trying to do the best we can.

151
00:27:38,397 --> 00:27:40,117
You're right.

152
00:27:42,116 --> 00:27:45,276
- I'd like you to meet Patrizia.
- Hello.

153
00:27:47,636 --> 00:27:51,916
Sit next to me. This way, Miss.
Take a seat.

154
00:27:58,275 --> 00:27:59,795
Hi, Aunty.

155
00:28:08,274 --> 00:28:10,712
Gennaro...

156
00:28:10,714 --> 00:28:13,354
Enjoy your meal.

157
00:28:14,834 --> 00:28:17,631
Only a little for me, Mom.

158
00:28:17,633 --> 00:28:20,151
- Mom, a lot for me.
- You're fading away.

159
00:28:20,153 --> 00:28:22,873
- There you go.
- Thanks.

160
00:28:34,952 --> 00:28:37,392
Central Naples is like a siren.

161
00:28:39,832 --> 00:28:41,911
She's there watching you.

162
00:28:43,031 --> 00:28:45,951
Then you hear her singing
and you fall in love...

163
00:28:47,751 --> 00:28:50,631
...and meanwhile
you've smashed into the rocks.

164
00:28:52,111 --> 00:28:55,750
Uncle, I'm under attack.

165
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,830
I need your help.

166
00:29:12,829 --> 00:29:15,907
- Nice to meet you. Mickey.
- Don't bother the lady.

167
00:29:15,909 --> 00:29:20,506
If she wants to ask me for the water,
she doesn't know what to call me.

168
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:22,066
She can ask me.

169
00:29:22,068 --> 00:29:25,668
Grazia, leave your brother alone
and help me clear the table.

170
00:29:30,427 --> 00:29:32,307
My name's Patrizia.

171
00:29:33,387 --> 00:29:35,747
See? Her name's Patrizia.

172
00:29:37,267 --> 00:29:38,787
Nice to meet you.

173
00:29:44,306 --> 00:29:46,466
- Will you excuse me?
- Of course.

174
00:29:52,985 --> 00:29:55,185
Uncle, I have a surprise for you.

175
00:30:08,864 --> 00:30:11,582
Christ's Tears.

176
00:30:11,584 --> 00:30:14,544
The hope of always being reborn
into a new life.

177
00:30:18,663 --> 00:30:23,503
I was afraid that seeing you,
I would have seen your father.

178
00:30:28,063 --> 00:30:30,422
Instead you have your mother's eyes.

179
00:30:32,302 --> 00:30:37,100
What Pietro refused to understand
was the strength of family.

180
00:30:37,102 --> 00:30:40,701
Today you have a problem,
tomorrow I have one...

181
00:30:47,581 --> 00:30:49,421
He's so beautiful.

182
00:30:50,861 --> 00:30:53,220
Little guy.

183
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:04,419
Everything you asked me,
consider it done, Gennaro.

184
00:31:08,019 --> 00:31:10,179
Thank you, Uncle.

185
00:31:20,898 --> 00:31:22,538
It's nice here, huh?

186
00:31:25,418 --> 00:31:26,778
The truth?

187
00:31:27,818 --> 00:31:31,175
I don't like the country one little bit.

188
00:31:31,177 --> 00:31:32,697
Why's that?

189
00:31:35,577 --> 00:31:38,135
We come from the earth,
we return to the earth

190
00:31:38,137 --> 00:31:41,016
and I don't want
to get muddy in between.

191
00:31:43,576 --> 00:31:45,934
I'll tell you a secret,

192
00:31:45,936 --> 00:31:48,894
I don't like the country either.

193
00:31:48,896 --> 00:31:51,896
That's why I went
to university in Bologna.

194
00:31:53,935 --> 00:31:55,893
But you came back here.

195
00:31:55,895 --> 00:31:59,175
Like plants,
our roots are difficult to break.

196
00:32:01,815 --> 00:32:04,292
I don't have any.

197
00:32:04,294 --> 00:32:06,094
That's impossible.

198
00:32:07,294 --> 00:32:10,774
You don't have a home,
a family, nothing?

199
00:32:11,814 --> 00:32:16,493
Everything I have fits in a suitcase
and I don't want to open it.

200
00:32:17,853 --> 00:32:19,853
And don't you miss it?

201
00:32:26,093 --> 00:32:28,652
What am I supposed to miss?

202
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:08,247
Come here, don't be afraid.

203
00:33:08,249 --> 00:33:12,207
Easy does it.
Come here, my beauty.

204
00:33:12,209 --> 00:33:14,169
This one's worth a lot, right?

205
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:22,688
Come.

206
00:33:24,008 --> 00:33:26,126
Don't be afraid.

207
00:33:26,128 --> 00:33:28,245
I got him.

208
00:33:28,247 --> 00:33:30,727
I'll put him in, or he might escape.

209
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:38,205
You made friends with the girl.

210
00:33:38,207 --> 00:33:41,844
- She's very smart.
- She'll never be smart enough.

211
00:33:41,846 --> 00:33:44,406
She's a woman,
she needs to stay in her place.

212
00:33:46,126 --> 00:33:48,924
Maybe the world's changing, Dad.

213
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:51,484
The world's changing,

214
00:33:51,486 --> 00:33:55,283
but we stay the same,
that's our strength.

215
00:33:55,285 --> 00:33:58,963
Mickey, take your jacket off
and grab a bag.

216
00:33:58,965 --> 00:34:00,365
Coming.

217
00:34:26,923 --> 00:34:29,082
I still haven't told you...

218
00:34:34,042 --> 00:34:36,682
I'm sorry about Ciro.

219
00:36:13,114 --> 00:36:15,072
- How long do we have?
- It's for tonight.

220
00:36:15,074 --> 00:36:19,191
I spoke to the Albanians,
the meetup's at the betting shop.

221
00:36:19,193 --> 00:36:21,391
We gotta hurry.

222
00:36:21,393 --> 00:36:22,993
C'mon, move it.

223
00:37:07,989 --> 00:37:12,429
Look, you turn it on here
and press this button.

224
00:37:27,028 --> 00:37:28,747
Everything's ready.

225
00:37:30,107 --> 00:37:35,585
The neighborhood's completely secured.
If they stop you, you know what to say?

226
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,905
Good girl, go.

227
00:37:37,907 --> 00:37:40,024
Whatever you need.

228
00:37:40,026 --> 00:37:41,906
And drive slowly.

229
00:38:39,582 --> 00:38:41,939
- Where are you going?
- I'm a friend of Papele's niece.

230
00:38:41,941 --> 00:38:44,101
I came to show her the kid.

231
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:50,101
Andrea, all good!

232
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:54,140
Nicola, all good.

233
00:40:07,254 --> 00:40:10,812
- Hi, guys. Was the trip good?
- Smooth as butter.

234
00:40:10,814 --> 00:40:13,654
This is Crazy, Capaccio's other brother.

235
00:41:54,685 --> 00:41:58,003
The person who brought the car in
is not from Secondigliano.

236
00:41:58,005 --> 00:42:00,883
We had nothing to do with the bomb.

237
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:04,764
- Nor do we know who it was.
- But we have to answer back.

238
00:42:13,164 --> 00:42:17,683
Valerio, loyalty is a fine quality,
if you choose the right person.

239
00:42:19,723 --> 00:42:22,561
But if they're heading for disaster,
so are you.

240
00:42:22,563 --> 00:42:24,561
We're not the ones heading for disaster.

241
00:42:24,563 --> 00:42:26,083
Maybe not today.

242
00:42:32,682 --> 00:42:34,762
But tomorrow?

243
00:42:36,642 --> 00:42:38,920
Let's be clear about one thing:

244
00:42:38,922 --> 00:42:42,439
I came alone today
but Enzo is here with me.

245
00:42:42,441 --> 00:42:44,801
What you do is none of our business.

246
00:42:46,681 --> 00:42:50,561
The first rule in Switzerland
is to mind one's own business.

247
00:43:03,799 --> 00:43:05,999
Did you speak to Loran?

248
00:43:07,479 --> 00:43:09,719
What did that Albanian turd tell you?

249
00:43:18,158 --> 00:43:22,356
<i>A loud explosion, flames,
the wounded screaming for help.</i>

250
00:43:22,358 --> 00:43:27,396
<i>A horrifying scene
for the first responders...</i>

251
00:43:27,398 --> 00:43:29,395
He crashed.

252
00:43:29,397 --> 00:43:32,115
You can tell he's been playing
all afternoon.

253
00:43:32,117 --> 00:43:34,675
He didn't even finish eating.

254
00:43:34,677 --> 00:43:36,797
Did you really have to?

255
00:43:40,196 --> 00:43:42,196
There were kids there.

256
00:43:43,636 --> 00:43:47,236
- Nothing happened to them.
- But it could have.

257
00:43:50,756 --> 00:43:53,793
Before a sunny day
you need a storm to clean the air.

258
00:43:53,795 --> 00:43:56,233
You said it.

259
00:43:56,235 --> 00:43:59,233
You promised that you'd end this war,
remember?

260
00:43:59,235 --> 00:44:03,794
I remember, actually
I stopped it before it started.

261
00:44:09,954 --> 00:44:12,394
Blue Blood didn't help Gennaro.

262
00:44:13,674 --> 00:44:17,153
The Albanians told the Levantes
that you were at the betting shop.

263
00:44:20,873 --> 00:44:24,391
What do the Levantes have to do
with Gennaro Savastano?

264
00:44:24,393 --> 00:44:29,550
They're related, Donna Imma and
Gerlando Levante's wife were cousins.

265
00:44:29,552 --> 00:44:31,670
Don Pietro didn't want
to see them anymore

266
00:44:31,672 --> 00:44:33,830
after the Levantes became affiliated
with the Sicilians.

267
00:44:33,832 --> 00:44:38,950
He was scared they'd devour him
and Secondigliano.

268
00:44:38,952 --> 00:44:41,591
That asshole son of his
isn't afraid, though.

269
00:44:43,551 --> 00:44:47,309
Gennaro feels stronger,
but he needs to be careful,

270
00:44:47,311 --> 00:44:49,429
they're very powerful.

271
00:44:49,431 --> 00:44:52,990
Gennaro can get God Almighty
to help him, I don't give a shit.

272
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:57,708
We gotta fight back,
we gotta get even straightaway.

273
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:00,748
This isn't the time to get angry.

274
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:04,389
You came to my house to talk to me,
you need to listen to me.

275
00:45:10,669 --> 00:45:14,509
You can't afford a war
with the Levantes and Gennaro.

276
00:45:16,228 --> 00:45:18,548
You need to reach an agreement.

277
00:45:19,748 --> 00:45:22,388
I'll be the guarantor for a meeting.

278
00:46:48,381 --> 00:46:50,381
- Hi, Patrizia.
- Gennaro.

279
00:47:12,139 --> 00:47:14,699
So, what did you want
to talk to us about?

280
00:47:20,378 --> 00:47:23,298
We thought the best thing
is to make a deal between us.

281
00:47:31,697 --> 00:47:34,457
That's exactly what I thought.

282
00:47:37,697 --> 00:47:39,736
The deal is this.

283
00:47:41,096 --> 00:47:43,614
Three things have to be sacred
for all of us.

284
00:47:43,616 --> 00:47:47,014
The first: Secondigliano
has to be independent,

285
00:47:47,016 --> 00:47:49,734
not under the control
of the other clans.

286
00:47:49,736 --> 00:47:54,335
I will guarantee that Secondigliano will
not make any requests in your areas.

287
00:47:55,615 --> 00:47:59,495
The second:
enough with wars.

288
00:48:00,975 --> 00:48:05,172
Wars are bad for everybody,
and especially for business.

289
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:07,692
The cops need to forget our faces,

290
00:48:07,694 --> 00:48:10,812
for them we all need
to come across as brothers,

291
00:48:10,814 --> 00:48:13,854
even though we never have been
and never will be.

292
00:48:15,773 --> 00:48:19,651
The third: whoever wants to do business
with Secondigliano is welcome.

293
00:48:19,653 --> 00:48:21,571
The price will be the same for everybody

294
00:48:21,573 --> 00:48:25,693
and everybody will sell at the same
agreed price in their area.

295
00:48:26,853 --> 00:48:29,012
That way there is no competition.

296
00:48:30,612 --> 00:48:32,532
And what do you earn?

297
00:48:37,252 --> 00:48:40,449
Freedom,

298
00:48:40,451 --> 00:48:42,769
for me and for my family.

299
00:48:42,771 --> 00:48:44,971
What does that mean?

300
00:48:46,851 --> 00:48:49,931
That from tomorrow in Secondigliano
Donna Patrizia is in charge.

301
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:05,007
Only a woman can raise a child properly.

302
00:49:05,009 --> 00:49:08,927
And this peace is like a child,

303
00:49:08,929 --> 00:49:11,687
and it will have Donna Patrizia
as its mother

304
00:49:11,689 --> 00:49:14,129
and Gerlando Levante as its father.

305
00:49:18,008 --> 00:49:21,846
Nothing changes for you,
Patrizia has my suppliers.

306
00:49:21,848 --> 00:49:24,368
You pay her
and she'll give you the stuff.

307
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:31,367
Are we all agreed?

308
00:49:36,247 --> 00:49:38,127
And you?

309
00:49:50,086 --> 00:49:52,565
From today on
you won't see me ever again.

310
00:49:57,085 --> 00:49:59,485
I wish you all good luck.

311
00:50:44,401 --> 00:50:46,721
What is this place, Gennaro?

312
00:50:51,800 --> 00:50:53,400
It's a surprise.

313
00:51:04,599 --> 00:51:06,359
Come.

314
00:51:32,317 --> 00:51:35,237
This is the first day of our new life.

315
00:51:38,597 --> 00:51:41,634
This place is like us,

316
00:51:41,636 --> 00:51:44,516
for everybody else,
it's not worth anything now.

317
