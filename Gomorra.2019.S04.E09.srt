2
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:14,480
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Goliath tipped me off.

3
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,600
We need drugs, Elia.

4
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,880
Soldiers make war.
The commander only strategizes.

5
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,720
Time for strategy is over.

6
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,440
Or not?

7
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,280
Let's go shopping, guys!

8
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,000
But what the fuck are you doing there?

9
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,680
Get outta here.

10
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,600
Pieces of shit!

11
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,600
Let's go.

12
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,558
<i>This is one of the scenes
of last night's shooting</i>

13
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,318
<i>that took place around 2am
in the Forcella area.</i>

14
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,838
<i>The reason for the attack
is still not clear,</i>

15
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,078
<i>but investigators are following
the lead of gang rivalry.</i>

16
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,678
<i>Terror among the residents,</i>

17
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,758
<i>who fear this may only be
the beginning of a new feud,</i>

18
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:35,838
<i>like the one that took over
the historic center last year.</i>

19
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,518
<i>The victims' names
have not yet been released,</i>

20
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,998
<i>but they're all very young,
between 18 and 23.</i>

21
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,520
<i>The police commissioner of Naples
has arrived on the crime scene.</i>

22
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,440
We haven't got a gram of stuff left.

23
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,920
Only he knew where it was.

24
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,640
Yet another fine gift
from that scumbag Valerio.

25
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,918
The time's come to wipe off
the Capaccios of the face of the earth.

26
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,078
You're right.

27
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,398
But before shooting,
we need to know if we can.

28
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,920
Do you hear what you're saying,
Pure'n'Simple?

29
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,078
You also got a kid coming.

30
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,678
What are you gonna teach him?

31
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,238
That if they kill your brother
you look the other way?

32
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,160
You don't understand a fucking thing.

33
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,960
I'm willing to die for Forcella.

34
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,880
But there's gotta be a good reason.

35
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,840
If you want to kill the Capaccios,
I'm with you.

36
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,438
But also if you want
to negotiate with them.

37
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,318
We can't afford a war right now.

38
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,118
Enzo, you gotta talk to them.

39
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,200
We're on our own.

40
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,558
The Capaccios came onto our turf
because they thought they could.

41
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,480
We can't negotiate with them,
the war's already begun.

42
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:25,640
But I agree with you:
we can't be on our own.

43
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,720
Donna Patrizia...

44
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,438
Did you hear what happened?
The Capaccios have gotten out.

45
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,880
This is a problem for everybody,
including you.

46
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,240
Nicola betrayed us to go with them,
didn't he? Valerio did the same.

47
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,960
They took all our stashes.

48
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,760
I'm sorry.

49
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,398
You gotta decide.

50
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,638
You wanna be with us

51
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,040
or wait till they come
and fucking take Secondigliano?

52
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:58,078
For now I can't go to war with anyone.

53
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,560
I can't help you,
you have to handle it on your own.

54
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,118
Central Naples' issues can't come here.

55
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,120
Secondigliano has
to remain independent.

56
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,518
Mr Savastano,
the staff will be here soon.

57
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,560
It's best if you're not seen here
during the day.

58
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,278
D'you see I changed
the name on the door?

59
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,360
Thank you.

60
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,878
Anyway, don't worry.

61
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,880
I just came to shake my new CEO 's hand.

62
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,000
- Is that a problem?
- No.

63
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,518
Tomorrow there's the press conference
for the reopening of the site.

64
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,880
I've written a short speech
and I want to remember Alberto.

65
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,198
I'll say he was an honest
businessman and a great man

66
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,040
and that his death in a tragic
accident has affected us all.

67
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,160
And what more is there to say?

68
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,080
And if they ask me questions?

69
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,438
You smile,

70
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,360
and say that the streets are no longer
safe, so we're taking to the sky.

71
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,440
We're on our own, guys.

72
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,520
But we can't stop.

73
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,000
I need to know if you're with me.

74
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,800
Because I have to count on all of you.

75
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,958
We gotta know all
about the Capaccios:

76
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,718
what they do, when they sleep,
when they piss.

77
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,080
If we have friends in their area,
now's the time to ask for favors.

78
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:08,038
Forcella's ours and no one
must take it away from us.

79
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,760
What are you waiting for? Come on!

80
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:15,318
Let's go, Pure'n'Simple.

81
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,880
Let's go, guys.

82
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,600
Enzo's closed off the neighborhood.

83
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,118
He's locked himself in a cage.

84
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,798
He won't stop till he's killed you.

85
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,880
He's got no coke, no money, he hasn't
even got the loyalty of his soldiers.

86
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,558
We just have to wait.

87
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,160
All water runs to the sea.

88
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,158
If we lose control of Forcella
someone's gonna step in.

89
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,200
And not necessarily a friend of yours.

90
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,520
Ferdinando, you know he's right?

91
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:43,080
But if he's here, it means
he and his friends have got an idea.

92
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,678
A friend of my cousin's
from the Luzzatti neighborhood

93
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,038
says that Crazy goes for a massage
at a Chinese-parlor every week.

94
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,800
Tonight too, she gave me the address.

95
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,358
Enzo, are you serious?

96
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,878
We don't know the place,
we don't know if he goes alone.

97
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,678
But there's no time.

98
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:36,358
We can't miss this opportunity,
we need to take out that asshole.

99
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,640
The sooner the better.

100
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,720
If you don't feel like it, never mind.

101
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,120
Tonight we'll whack the bastard.

102
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,280
You did good.

103
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,760
You can sit there, Mr Savastano.

104
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,878
So, Mr Savastano, if you're sure
you want to go ahead,

105
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,318
we can do the first treatment tomorrow,
both for the scar and the tattoo.

106
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,718
It's a very simple procedure
with a local anaesthetic.

107
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,678
Thank you.

108
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,160
- You want to meet him?
- Who?

109
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,560
The new Gennaro Savastano.

110
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,440
Where is he?

111
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:53,160
Stay here, I'll go check.

112
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,678
What was that?

113
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:46,278
- Let's go see.
- Enzo said to stay here.

114
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,678
As soon as they come out, we gotta go.

115
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,838
You stay here. Let's go, bro'.

116
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:53,320
Where are you going?

117
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,838
- What the fuck happened?
- It was a trap, he sold us out.

118
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,560
They're in the hallway.

119
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,440
We gotta get outta here!

120
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,158
The scumbag sold us out, Enzo!

121
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,640
Let's go!

122
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:41,840
- What happened?
- Nothing, go. Go, go!

123
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,480
Fuck it!

124
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,000
We're losing.

125
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,600
We're losing our brothers.

126
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,760
Are you okay?

127
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Valerio said he once saw something
in me that's not there now.

128
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,598
If he didn't see it,
that doesn't mean it's not still there.

129
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,440
Besides, what Valerio said
doesn't count anymore.

130
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,320
He was a rat.

131
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:01,488
I'm really pleased
you're doing this for yourself.

132
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,170
The doctor said it's nothing,
don't worry.

133
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:12,210
What's the matter?

134
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:19,888
Tiziana was a little tense.

135
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,048
I'll drop in on the press
conference first,

136
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:25,210
so I can check
everything's under control.

137
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:30,690
You know you can't go, right?

138
00:21:35,210 --> 00:21:36,808
I know you've changed,

139
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:40,130
but for the rest of the world
you're Gennaro Savastano.

140
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:43,890
The boss of Secondigliano.

141
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:49,810
But if it will put your mind at rest,
I'll go to the press conference.

142
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:04,730
What the fuck have I done
all this shit for?

143
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:10,090
The airport, the consortium,
the company...

144
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:15,448
Only to end up like my father,

145
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:18,770
who lived his whole life
trapped in a golden cage.

146
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:27,450
The difference is everything
your father did, he did it for himself.

147
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,490
You're doing it for your son.

148
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:40,090
And that's something
you mustn't forget.

149
00:22:59,610 --> 00:23:03,208
What the fuck did you do?
It's a miracle I'm alive!

150
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:06,368
- I see you're still here.
- And so's Enzo.

151
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:09,050
- And that's a problem.
- Yeah, but calm down.

152
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:26,288
We're risking big,

153
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:28,610
and we can't afford it anymore.

154
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:31,888
We have to destroy Enzo
before he recovers.

155
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:35,130
If you're in such a hurry
why don't you kill Enzo yourself?

156
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:41,848
Because no one would want a rat
in charge of Forcella.

157
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:44,570
But Blue Blood's no longer up to it,
like Patrizia.

158
00:23:46,050 --> 00:23:49,168
And when stuff goes bad
you throw it out.

159
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,850
Don't you?

160
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:58,290
See what you can do.

161
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:32,170
Valerio said if anything happened
to him, I was to give you this.

162
00:24:43,810 --> 00:24:46,250
For my son you were his family.

163
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:49,530
That's what he told me.

164
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,690
"His family."

165
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:20,330
We've lost another battle
but it's not over.

166
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:26,768
We need to collect as much money
as we can for more drugs,

167
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:30,528
but we need to keep something
for our friend's families,

168
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:33,288
because no one

169
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:36,890
must say that
we've been weakened in Forcella.

170
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:47,408
Go ask for the week's money
from those who haven't paid yet,

171
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:51,810
then go to the warehouse,
bring back everything we've got left.

172
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,650
You handle security
in the neighborhood, is that clear?

173
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,448
I'll take care of the drugs.

174
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,050
Let's go.

175
00:27:16,930 --> 00:27:19,690
I'm not letting you go alone,
I'll come too.

176
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:23,448
I made up my mind, Pure'n'Simple.

177
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,370
Will you tell me what happened?

178
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:32,168
- He wants to go to his contact alone.
- No way.

179
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:35,728
You're about to have a kid.
We already lost too many brothers.

180
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,488
I'm going alone, it's easier.

181
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:40,010
Enzo's right, you need
to stay in the neighborhood.

182
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,290
I'll come with you.

183
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,090
I'm good.

184
00:28:03,010 --> 00:28:04,450
I'm on my way.

185
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:05,370
You're done, Blue Blood.

186
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:09,970
This is the last time you fuck up.

187
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:16,130
You wanna kill me
like you did with Valerio?

188
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,290
Don't push me.

189
00:29:40,610 --> 00:29:42,610
He left me a note.

190
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:48,328
You went over to the Capaccios
to screw him first, and then me.

191
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,770
You're nobody!

192
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:11,448
He said there's a big shot behind you.

193
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,810
I want to know who he is.

194
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:19,970
Why don't you ask your buddy?

195
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,770
Because the dead can't talk.

196
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:55,008
We didn't know anything,
we don't know how Enzo found out.

197
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:59,088
We got nothing to hide. If you
don't believe it, you can kill us.

198
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,850
No, I believe you.

199
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,970
That's why you're still here.

200
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:10,848
But if you want to stay alive,
bring me my brother.

201
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:13,770
- We'll need time.
- We don't know where he is.

202
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:21,210
If Ferdinando doesn't come back,
you know what happens?

203
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:28,770
A dog without a master
doesn't live long on the street.

204
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,450
Leave it.

205
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,010
- Only I can save you.
- Yeah?

206
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:57,648
But you gotta tell me who's backing you.

207
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:00,570
- And what would that change for you?
- Just tell me!

208
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:04,250
If I tell you now, you'll kill me.

209
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:08,008
It'd be the end of me.

210
00:32:08,010 --> 00:32:10,770
You decide how much you want to suffer.

211
00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:14,810
But you gotta talk.

212
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:23,930
Because Valerio died trying
to find this out.

213
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:34,330
- And I gotta finish what he started.
- Then finish it!

214
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:46,168
- You're done playing crazy.
- You wanna do it?

215
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:48,930
He's shitting himself.
Now let's fuck him up.

216
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,770
When?

217
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:57,970
- On my way.
- Sack of shit!

218
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:05,128
Enzo, Anna called.

219
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:09,010
She's giving birth. I gotta go.

220
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:49,130
Good morning.

221
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,570
Good morning.

222
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:58,288
Can Simone come play at our place
one of these days?

223
00:33:58,290 --> 00:34:00,530
Pietro would like that a lot.

224
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:06,088
We'll come pick him up at your place

225
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:07,770
and take him home again.

226
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:16,690
I wouldn't want to bother you.

227
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:21,130
But that's not the truth.

228
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:26,848
And we said we'd always
tell each other the truth.

229
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:30,408
The problem isn't bothering me.

230
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:32,370
It's who I am.

231
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:39,970
But now, also thanks to you,
I know who I am.

232
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:55,010
Come along, sweetheart.

233
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:19,690
Anna, what happened?

234
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,210
Is everything all right?

235
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:27,528
What is it? Is everything all right?

236
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:29,448
Baby...

237
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:33,170
Before you judge,
listen to what they have to say.

238
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:37,610
I want our son
to grow up with a father.

239
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:57,890
Pure'n'Simple...

240
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:02,170
Enzo's losing.

241
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:06,690
You know it yourself,
things can't go on like this.

242
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:10,288
They're with us too.

243
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:13,248
We don't want to fight a war
between brothers

244
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,048
and we're sick to fucking death
of losing our men.

245
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:18,010
We've done big things together.

246
00:36:20,730 --> 00:36:23,728
But we're not kids anymore.

247
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:26,848
Pure'n'Simple, it's better for everyone
if we go over to the Capaccios.

248
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:29,810
And what's the price for all this?

249
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:33,290
You know all too well.

250
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,810
Answer.

251
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:02,210
- Enzo.
- All good?

252
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:07,530
We gotta celebrate.

253
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:12,170
What are you going to call him?

254
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:21,328
Anna wants to call him Valerio
like his grandfather.

255
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:23,250
But I said no.

256
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:26,970
My son can't have a traitor's name.

257
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:33,170
We gotta go. They're coming.

258
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:37,450
I want to name him after you.

259
00:37:38,810 --> 00:37:40,770
Because you're my brother.

260
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:47,290
I'll see you later, Enzo.

261
00:38:17,490 --> 00:38:19,370
What's going on?

262
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:22,850
I want to show you something.

263
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:39,690
Tell us who's behind you.

264
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:50,850
Your husband's lucky.

265
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:55,090
Because he fucked you twice.

266
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:00,210
Once in bed and once in business.

267
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:06,810
They want to take Secondigliano,
him and his family.

268
00:39:08,690 --> 00:39:12,130
And they want to stick it up your ass.

269
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:26,450
They wiped out all my brothers.

270
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:30,010
Forcella's in the Graduate's hands now.

271
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:35,610
You can still make it.

272
00:40:21,029 --> 00:40:26,029
