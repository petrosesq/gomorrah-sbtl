2
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,758
Mimmo, come take a look!

3
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,000
- Stop!
- Giovanni, come take a look.

4
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,160
Never seen anything like it,
it's unbelievable.

5
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,518
- Good morning, Gianni.
- Good morning, ma'am.

6
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,878
- Did you tell anyone else?
- No, just you.

7
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,440
Come, this way.

8
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,520
And what do we do now?

9
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,160
I have to notify Mr. Resta.

10
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,438
Can I rely on the silence
of your workers?

11
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,240
- I guarantee it personally.
- Thank you.

12
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,880
Hi, man.

13
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,518
Well? Do we have any more information?

14
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:58,318
As we thought:
illegal dumping from a cemetery.

15
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,478
I really don't see the problem.

16
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,478
They've been dead for over 40 years
and don't have relatives,

17
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,918
or they would have seen to them.

18
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:11,958
What difference does it make if they're
in an ossuary or under a carpark?

19
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,158
Besides, Gennaro, cemeteries
swindle money from City Hall

20
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,638
and we should pay
for the fraud they commit?

21
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:23,440
Listen, we'll put them back
where they were and close it up.

22
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,120
Come here, Alberto.

23
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:46,880
- What are we building?
- An airport.

24
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,200
How many others have tried
to build another airport in this city?

25
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,880
Only we succeeded.

26
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,118
You know why?

27
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,798
Because we've done
everything by the book.

28
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,918
Without greasing palms,
without offending anyone

29
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,118
and especially without fucking up.

30
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:17,118
Now, if we do as you suggest
and it comes out,

31
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:19,720
we'll blow everything
we've done 'til now.

32
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,880
Pardon me.

33
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,760
I have to take this, I'll be right back.

34
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,320
Hi, Fernando. How come at this hour?

35
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,120
Hold on, I'll just go in the office.

36
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,878
- You don't agree with him, do you?
- I know these people well.

37
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,998
It's impossible that the workers
will all keep quiet.

38
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,400
It'll come out for sure
and, at that point, we risk big.

39
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,878
What would you do?

40
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,240
I'd get ahead of it
and go into damage control.

41
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,200
- What can happen?
- The prosecutor will open a file.

42
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,520
Okay, let's go.

43
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,320
It's him. Guys!

44
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,838
- Good morning everyone.
- Mr Resta, what can you tell us?

45
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,558
I can't tell you much
because it's still under investigation.

46
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,958
However, I'd like to stress
that our consortium

47
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,918
has always acted
lawfully, transparently.

48
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,198
Although we are the injured party
in this sad situation,

49
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:18,678
we have decided to cover
the cost of the operation

50
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:24,838
<i>for the removal of the remains
that criminals have buried in our land,</i>

51
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,758
<i>freeing the council from an expense
it already shouldered.</i>

52
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:33,638
<i>We are investing in this area
because we believe in it,</i>

53
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,438
<i>we believe in opportunities
that can be created</i>

54
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:39,358
<i>based on work and transparency.</i>

55
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,960
<i>This was the statement
from Alberto Resta...</i>

56
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,358
- He was good.
- The voice is his.

57
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,478
But the brain behind him is Tiziana's.

58
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,358
It was her idea to report parties
unknown for the dumping of waste.

59
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,878
But if they shut down the site?

60
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,678
Tiziana says we need
public opinion on our side,

61
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:03,560
then we'll say this seizure harms us
and the community.

62
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,800
Let's go,
or we'll be late for the school party.

63
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:36,318
In the end we didn't meet:
Walter Ruggieri, Simone's dad.

64
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,838
Gennaro Savastano, Pietro's dad.

65
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:42,078
Your last name
is more famous than mine.

66
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,000
It's the price I have to pay.

67
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,158
I know,
I shouldn't in front of the kids.

68
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,520
But there are lots of things
we shouldn't do, but we do, right?

69
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,720
Who we are is sculpted
into our flesh, we can't help it.

70
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,918
My father abandoned me
when I was two months old

71
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,880
and turned up again
when I was 20 years old.

72
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,760
He wanted to meet me.

73
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:19,678
I went, because I'm not afraid
to go and see.

74
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,000
But that was the day
I decided I didn't want kids.

75
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,358
But your son's right there.

76
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,520
I know. My wife insisted,
she pestered me to death.

77
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,600
And there he is.

78
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,638
The first two years I desperately
looked for feelings inside me,

79
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,958
but I didn't have any,
he just annoyed me when he cried.

80
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,558
I shouldn't say that, I know.

81
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,160
That's why I chose this job.

82
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,038
Justice has no mercy for anyone,
its only companion is the truth.

83
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,200
And the truth is I'm a prosecutor
and you're the son of a missing boss.

84
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,840
But that shitty man who gave me life
still stirs in my blood.

85
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,560
And you?

86
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,480
Excuse me.

87
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,960
What did he want?

88
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,280
He just wanted to introduce himself.

89
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,840
And he wanted to scare me a little.

90
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:09,558
- Hi, Ferdinando.
- Hi, Alberto.

91
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,640
Well? What's going on?

92
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,758
I've got anti-money laundering
at the bank.

93
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,478
They want to know
how a businessman riddled with debt

94
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,440
found the money to put in the
consortium that's building the airport.

95
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,638
I'm investing in a new company and
with the profits I'll repay my debts.

96
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:35,558
They've got it in for the company
you used to join the consortium,

97
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,798
as it started out with a capital
of 20 thousand euros,

98
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,318
then received two British investments
and the capital grew to five million.

99
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,558
And?

100
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:48,518
Trust me, get out of it all now,

101
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:52,838
go to the prosecutor and give them
the names of who's behind the airport.

102
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,718
There's no name to give.

103
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,198
If the law hasn't changed overnight,
blind trusts are legal.

104
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,438
Sheer conjecture, that's not enough.

105
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,358
But anti-money laundering
doesn't move for no reason.

106
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,400
Are you really willing to pay the price?

107
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:15,798
The bank wants you
to repay your debt immediately,

108
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,918
or they'll start bankruptcy proceedings.

109
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,320
I see.

110
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,120
Thanks for the heads up.

111
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,278
My Jesus, forgive us our sins.

112
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,958
Save us from the fires of Hell.

113
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:43,398
Lead all souls to Heaven,

114
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,360
especially those
in most need of Thy mercy.

115
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,560
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost.

116
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,720
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with Thee...

117
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,878
Hello?

118
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,758
Now and at the hour of our death, amen.

119
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,238
Out of the depths I cry to you, O, Lord.

120
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,478
Lord, hear my voice,

121
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,998
let Your ears be attentive
to my cry for mercy.

122
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,280
If You keep a record of sins, Lord,
who could withstand Your judgement?

123
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,678
- Hi, Alberto.
- Hi, Gennaro.

124
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,200
- What's with all the mystery?
- Precautions.

125
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:28,080
Did you see me today? Was I good?

126
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,520
You were good.
Why did you want to see me?

127
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,880
The bank's asked me to repay my debt.

128
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,240
I dunno, it must be this fucking thing
with the skeletons.

129
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,080
- How much do you owe?
- 150 grand.

130
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,518
Tomorrow morning I'll give you
the names of three companies,

131
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:04,358
prepare three invoices for consultancy
to the amount you need.

132
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:06,478
Thanks, Gennaro. You're a friend.

133
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,998
I'm just a businessman
looking after his interests.

134
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,438
If you have problems,
the consortium has problems.

135
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,840
That's all.

136
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,878
Let me through!

137
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,518
You're a robot.

138
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,720
Yeah and I wanna go through...

139
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,320
Now we'll show Mama the robot.

140
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,440
Show her.

141
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,318
Did you show Papa the drawings
you did at school?

142
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,998
You did some drawings?

143
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,318
He did a kite, a house...

144
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,518
Want some coffee?

145
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,918
- Our house?
- A house with the pool.

146
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,958
Did you do a drawing of Papa?

147
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,760
We're done upstairs.

148
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:09,440
Finish your yoghurt, I'll be right back.

149
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,798
- Well?
- It's all clean here.

150
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,918
But we can't give you 100% certainty.

151
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,598
If they turned off the detectors,
we won't find them.

152
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,678
We'll get our stuff and go, goodbye.

153
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,440
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

154
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,280
If someone got in we would have noticed.

155
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,278
When we're not here,
it's easy to get in.

156
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,680
Gennaro, they didn't find anything.

157
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,520
Maybe I got spooked.

158
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,998
Or maybe that son of bitch told me
that stuff on purpose.

159
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,958
He knew I'd check.

160
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,918
First he planted the doubt
then he took it away.

161
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,000
So, in his mind, I'd go back
to talking normally about our stuff.

162
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,358
And even if that's true?

163
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,320
After today we have nothing bad
to talk about anymore.

164
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,880
Come in.

165
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,560
May I come in?

166
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,640
This is from our family.

167
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,080
It belonged to Mama's grandmother.

168
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,960
Don't give it to me,
wear it when you get married.

169
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,158
No, I'll never get married.

170
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,200
I don't need bosses,
I have enough at home.

171
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,558
First you gotta learn
to be your own boss,

172
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,120
then you can find a man
who loves you and respects you.

173
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,360
The only one who respects me
is marrying you.

174
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,078
A husband and wife can break up,

175
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,600
but brother and sister
will always be brother and sister.

176
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,480
This one's from me.

177
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,760
See, you need it.

178
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,080
I'll always be on your side, Patrizia.

179
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,320
When you enter the church,
today, tomorrow...

180
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,000
I'll always be on your side.

181
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,520
Don't ever forget that.

182
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,280
Give me a hand.

183
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,040
Thank you.

184
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,838
I know we didn't get off
to a good start,

185
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,878
but today we're happy
to welcome you into this family.

186
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,120
Things change.

187
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:41,240
These are our flowers,
we picked them for you.

188
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,600
Thank you so much.

189
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,480
Look, there's even a pool.

190
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,000
- Shall we sit here?
- Yeah, let's sit here.

191
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,800
Anything you need
there's someone inside, okay?

192
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,640
Here.

193
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,640
- Bye, Pietro.
- Say goodbye to Papa.

194
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,200
Be good.

195
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,520
It's beautiful here, huh?

196
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:21,680
Yes.

197
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,720
Gennaro!

198
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,520
- Azzurra sends her regards.
- Thank her from me.

199
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,240
Hi, Uncle, all good?

200
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,800
Unfortunately I can't stay, but
I wanted to congratulate you in person.

201
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,120
And we're very glad you came.

202
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,558
Do you mind if I walk the bride
down the aisle?

203
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,640
That's if she agrees.

204
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,080
From today Secondigliano is yours.

205
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,880
Don't give me anything anymore,
keep what you earn.

206
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,920
- It's my wedding present.
- Why?

207
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,118
You're big enough
to walk on your own two feet.

208
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,360
But always be careful
of the people you trust.

209
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,880
Good luck, Patrizia.

210
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:58,878
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Ghost.

211
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,038
- Amen.
- The Lord be with you.

212
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:03,238
And with your spirit.

213
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:07,798
Dear Patrizia and Michelangelo, you
have come into the house of the Lord,

214
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,358
in the presence of the Church’s
minister and the community,

215
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:14,798
so your intention to enter into Marriage

216
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,240
may be strengthened with a sacred seal.

217
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:33,408
Excuse me.

218
00:26:33,410 --> 00:26:37,410
- Can you tell me where this office is?
- Down the end on the left.

219
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,650
Come in.

220
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:04,528
Good morning, I'm Alberto Resta.

221
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:08,170
Please, come in.
Can you close the door?

222
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:16,970
It's a pleasure.

223
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:26,288
Why have I been called in?

224
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:29,328
I just wanted to have
an informal chat with you.

225
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:33,848
So, LT Solid, headquarters in Panama.

226
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:38,450
CAD Industrial, Luxembourg,
and Sillow Connection, London.

227
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:41,530
Do you know these companies?

228
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:45,488
Of course, I work with them.

229
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:47,930
- What work?
- I'm a consultant.

230
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,768
I don't believe
there's anything illegal, is there?

231
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,808
No, there isn't.

232
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:57,008
There might be a couple of anomalies.

233
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,650
And what would they be?

234
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,568
These companies paid you
consultation fees

235
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:06,528
just in time to cover your exposure
with the bank.

236
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:09,568
No, it's exactly the opposite.

237
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:12,248
I had credits with these companies
for months

238
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:16,290
and I pressed them for payment
when the bank came down on me.

239
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,890
The second anomaly?

240
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,568
That they chose as a consultant

241
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:32,130
a businessman who without
murky capital would have failed.

242
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:39,570
I don't think I understand
what you're talking about.

243
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:57,250
Now, if our chat's over, I'd like to go.

244
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,128
Please, go.

245
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:05,850
I hope that after all these debts
you've learned to handle the tension.

246
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,210
Goodbye.

247
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:21,730
Is it good?

248
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,850
Well?

249
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:42,770
Patrizia accepted.

250
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:49,050
What else would she do?
You gave her this wedding present...

251
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:55,808
From today, all our ties with
Secondigliano are severed.

252
00:29:55,810 --> 00:29:58,930
They just have to let us reopen
the worksite.

253
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:07,170
- Tiziana is taking care of that.
- In the end, you were right...

254
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:11,370
To fly, a plane needs to detach
from the ground.

255
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:18,970
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

256
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,528
Tiziana...

257
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:33,648
All the funds transfers,
all the payments we've made,

258
00:30:33,650 --> 00:30:36,808
you verified them all, right?

259
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,568
Of course.

260
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:42,808
Is there any chance
something might look strange?

261
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:44,730
Absolutely not. Why?

262
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:50,770
- Are you sure? It's very important.
- Yes, I'm sure.

263
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:55,050
Nothing looks strange
about the funds or the payments.

264
00:30:57,050 --> 00:31:01,168
I know exactly what we're doing.
And with whom.

265
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,648
You hired me because
I'm competent, didn't you?

266
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:07,650
Do you think I'd let anything strange
show up and risk everything?

267
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:18,610
But now you have to tell me
what's going on.

268
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:26,850
I'll tell you, but it has
to stay between you and me.

269
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:14,410
Hi, Tiziana. Well?

270
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:22,410
Alberto was summoned
to the prosecutor's office.

271
00:32:28,170 --> 00:32:30,570
They asked him to name you.

272
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:34,170
But he held out, he protected you.

273
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:38,370
He wanted me to reassure him
about the accounts.

274
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:49,330
Maybe you know Alberto better than me.

275
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:03,690
But now I want you to tell me something.

276
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:08,570
Do you think he'll hold out
the next time, too?

277
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:52,890
It's beautiful, Gennaro.
It's really beautiful.

278
00:33:56,370 --> 00:33:58,010
I'm glad you like it.

279
00:33:59,330 --> 00:34:01,290
Do you wanna tell me why we're here?

280
00:34:16,450 --> 00:34:18,450
What are you thinking?

281
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:31,970
I'm thinking about those
who gave their lives to get us here.

282
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:14,770
- Beautiful, isn't it?
- It's beautiful.

283
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:20,570
If we buy it, I have connections
in City Hall for the restoration.

284
00:35:22,250 --> 00:35:24,770
The price you told me is favorable.

285
00:35:39,770 --> 00:35:41,650
You know, I had a friend...

286
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,330
a brother.

287
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:52,770
I look at the sea and think that he's
there, somewhere, watching me.

288
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:03,450
Anything you want to tell me, Alberto?

289
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:10,610
- No.
- Are you sure?

290
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:14,610
Yes.

291
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,250
All good, then.

292
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:25,010
What is it, Gennaro?

293
00:36:26,850 --> 00:36:28,810
Don't you trust me anymore?

294
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:33,970
Alberto, you know, I don't trust anyone.

295
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,530
But we're good.

296
00:36:55,010 --> 00:37:00,770
- So, do we buy this place or not?
- Of course! Of course we'll buy it.

297
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,810
Then let's buy it.

298
00:37:04,810 --> 00:37:06,490
Let's go.

299
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:42,370
- See you, Gennaro.
- See you, Alberto.

300
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:14,530
Fuck!

301
00:39:38,897 --> 00:39:43,897
