2
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:04,573
Mamma.

3
00:04:04,575 --> 00:04:06,895
How is everyone?

4
00:04:08,575 --> 00:04:11,655
- And you?
- I'm fine, I already told you.

5
00:04:27,495 --> 00:04:30,255
Mind telling me what the fuck happened?

6
00:04:32,415 --> 00:04:35,855
- Blue Blood tried to kill us all.
- He's not the problem!

7
00:04:37,575 --> 00:04:39,415
But whoever's behind him!

8
00:04:40,735 --> 00:04:44,093
They were waiting for me
in that shithole.

9
00:04:44,095 --> 00:04:46,533
She told you
Blue Blood was there, right?

10
00:04:46,535 --> 00:04:48,373
So what?

11
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:51,935
She doesn't know
that you're behind the bust.

12
00:04:53,095 --> 00:04:55,495
Or do you think I told her?

13
00:04:56,495 --> 00:04:59,533
We're only alive by a miracle.

14
00:04:59,535 --> 00:05:04,133
But not you...
You look like you've been for a stroll.

15
00:05:04,135 --> 00:05:07,135
Tell me to my face
if you think I tried to kill you.

16
00:05:08,935 --> 00:05:12,295
If I wanted you dead,
you'd be buried by now.

17
00:05:19,855 --> 00:05:22,613
We need to stay calm.

18
00:05:22,615 --> 00:05:25,653
Calm and united.

19
00:05:25,655 --> 00:05:28,813
We're under attack,

20
00:05:28,815 --> 00:05:33,135
and I want to be sure we don't have
enemies other than Blue Blood.

21
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:39,415
So, Michelangelo keep
your eyes open in Secondigliano.

22
00:05:40,535 --> 00:05:42,615
For you and for us.

23
00:05:45,455 --> 00:05:47,975
There's one thing
Michelangelo's right about.

24
00:05:49,775 --> 00:05:54,775
We're a family
and we gotta act like a family.

25
00:05:57,175 --> 00:05:58,815
Understood?

26
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:44,173
I handed the Levantes to you
on a silver platter,

27
00:06:44,175 --> 00:06:47,013
and yet they're still standing.

28
00:06:47,015 --> 00:06:50,173
Either they're very lucky,

29
00:06:50,175 --> 00:06:52,695
or they had a guardian angel.

30
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,895
Or maybe you're useless.

31
00:06:58,975 --> 00:07:01,413
To see if that's true
we gotta try again.

32
00:07:01,415 --> 00:07:04,815
Not now. Now you need to lie low.

33
00:07:06,215 --> 00:07:08,775
They're after you,
they mustn't find you here.

34
00:07:11,175 --> 00:07:12,895
You gotta get away.

35
00:07:17,415 --> 00:07:20,015
Patrizia, you know why I'm here.

36
00:07:24,055 --> 00:07:26,893
I want revenge, too,

37
00:07:26,895 --> 00:07:29,853
but at the right moment.

38
00:07:29,855 --> 00:07:32,415
Meanwhile, we gotta keep a low profile.

39
00:07:33,615 --> 00:07:35,295
Understood?

40
00:07:39,575 --> 00:07:41,255
Now get outta here.

41
00:08:28,735 --> 00:08:32,695
- Where have you been?
- At Enzo's with the guys, talking.

42
00:08:36,135 --> 00:08:38,013
What did you have to say?

43
00:08:38,015 --> 00:08:40,295
For now they gotta disappear.

44
00:08:43,295 --> 00:08:47,975
- What does your family say?
- They suspect you too.

45
00:08:49,935 --> 00:08:53,493
They're not sure,
but we got a spotlight on us.

46
00:08:53,495 --> 00:08:55,575
We have to be careful.

47
00:09:04,415 --> 00:09:07,453
Truth is, while they're alive,
we're not safe.

48
00:09:07,455 --> 00:09:10,255
And now I gotta take
Secondigliano back.

49
00:09:17,935 --> 00:09:19,695
Michelangelo!

50
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,053
Remember who we're doing it for.

51
00:09:27,055 --> 00:09:30,775
I know what I'm doing and who it's for,
no need to remind me.

52
00:09:34,335 --> 00:09:36,335
I know how you feel.

53
00:09:40,735 --> 00:09:43,575
But you gotta relax.

54
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,015
So far, there are no dead to mourn.

55
00:11:09,815 --> 00:11:11,135
Everything okay?

56
00:11:14,295 --> 00:11:16,775
Speed up a little.

57
00:11:23,135 --> 00:11:25,535
Turn right.

58
00:11:30,975 --> 00:11:33,775
Patrizia, don't turn around,
we got a car tailing us.

59
00:12:00,615 --> 00:12:02,693
So what do I do?

60
00:12:02,695 --> 00:12:05,413
- We'll go home.
- Let's finish our rounds.

61
00:12:05,415 --> 00:12:07,535
- Patrizia...
- I said let's go.

62
00:12:29,255 --> 00:12:31,135
Get out, I'll be right there.

63
00:12:41,175 --> 00:12:44,493
Don't you dare contradict me
in front of my men ever again!

64
00:12:44,495 --> 00:12:46,933
I'm in charge here.

65
00:12:46,935 --> 00:12:51,735
I can't let them see me weak,
neither in my house nor outside it.

66
00:12:53,055 --> 00:12:54,973
Then excuse me.

67
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:57,413
I thought I was talking to Bianca's mom,

68
00:12:57,415 --> 00:12:59,975
but I'm dealing with
the boss of Secondigliano.

69
00:13:57,215 --> 00:13:59,295
Where's my father?

70
00:14:04,535 --> 00:14:08,093
Papa! Why the fuck
have you got a car tailing us?

71
00:14:08,095 --> 00:14:10,293
Calm down, Michelangelo.

72
00:14:10,295 --> 00:14:13,013
You told me
to keep my eyes open and I did,

73
00:14:13,015 --> 00:14:15,375
but it seems you don't trust me.

74
00:14:17,175 --> 00:14:19,695
We've been attacked three times.

75
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:24,093
Someone's gotta be behind it.

76
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:27,375
Maybe it's only that little shit
from Forcella, maybe not.

77
00:14:29,975 --> 00:14:33,855
I watch my house and I do it well.

78
00:14:35,735 --> 00:14:38,695
I'm asking you, please,
you gotta trust me.

79
00:14:40,175 --> 00:14:42,295
You're my blood, Michelangelo.

80
00:14:45,735 --> 00:14:48,095
We all trust you.

81
00:15:41,855 --> 00:15:45,293
They confirmed, the shipment
arrives tomorrow morning.

82
00:15:45,295 --> 00:15:47,495
Good, I'll go.

83
00:15:51,055 --> 00:15:53,895
I don't like you going out on your own.

84
00:15:54,935 --> 00:15:57,013
Then we'll go together,

85
00:15:57,015 --> 00:15:59,453
that way they can't do anything to me.

86
00:15:59,455 --> 00:16:01,375
I'll go by myself.

87
00:16:02,655 --> 00:16:05,093
I need to be seen in the streets.

88
00:16:05,095 --> 00:16:08,093
As boss of Secondigliano
they gotta know I'm always there.

89
00:16:08,095 --> 00:16:10,893
If I hide like a rat, I'm nobody's boss.

90
00:16:10,895 --> 00:16:12,295
Patrizia...

91
00:16:16,735 --> 00:16:20,453
Please, listen to me.

92
00:16:20,455 --> 00:16:24,215
I have a bank account in Switzerland
with two million, why don't we leave?

93
00:16:25,295 --> 00:16:28,013
We can go and live wherever we want,

94
00:16:28,015 --> 00:16:30,333
far away from my family,
from all this shit.

95
00:16:30,335 --> 00:16:32,535
I don't want to go anywhere.

96
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,973
My place is here.

97
00:16:35,975 --> 00:16:38,693
You don't get it, they want to kill you!

98
00:16:38,695 --> 00:16:41,533
If they want to kill me, here I am,

99
00:16:41,535 --> 00:16:44,055
but they'll have to make war on my turf.

100
00:16:45,175 --> 00:16:48,693
When you married me,
you knew who I was.

101
00:16:48,695 --> 00:16:50,335
Yes, I knew.

102
00:16:51,815 --> 00:16:53,935
Tomorrow I'm going to the delivery.

103
00:16:57,095 --> 00:16:59,655
If you come, good,
you've chosen our family.

104
00:17:00,695 --> 00:17:04,775
But if you don't come, I'm sure Papa
will be glad to have you back home.

105
00:19:47,175 --> 00:19:49,175
Thank you for coming.

106
00:20:01,135 --> 00:20:04,973
- There's problems in Bologna.
- Bologna?

107
00:20:04,975 --> 00:20:07,653
That's strange, I didn't hear anything.

108
00:20:07,655 --> 00:20:10,175
I did.

109
00:20:13,735 --> 00:20:16,655
- And what do I do?
- You leave in the morning.

110
00:20:17,695 --> 00:20:20,053
I can't tomorrow.

111
00:20:20,055 --> 00:20:24,253
But don't worry, I'll make some calls
and straighten it out.

112
00:20:24,255 --> 00:20:27,455
Some problems can
only be solved in person.

113
00:20:32,495 --> 00:20:34,493
I'll go,

114
00:20:34,495 --> 00:20:38,615
but are you sure this problem
can't be solved any other way?

115
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:44,533
There are things
that people get whacked for,

116
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:47,535
before they even have time to apologize.

117
00:20:49,175 --> 00:20:52,053
Then there are sons,

118
00:20:52,055 --> 00:20:56,053
who mess up again and again,

119
00:20:56,055 --> 00:20:58,615
but you forgive them everything
'cause they're your kids.

120
00:21:21,815 --> 00:21:25,533
The other night, I had
three powerful charges put in,

121
00:21:25,535 --> 00:21:29,373
the same stuff we use at the quarry.

122
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,575
Her men are already here.

123
00:21:33,455 --> 00:21:37,615
Stand by with that gizmo,
we gonna bring the sky down.

124
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:20,135
Donna Patrizia,
the shipment's arriving now.

125
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,535
Let's go.

126
00:22:35,015 --> 00:22:39,013
- They're opening the gate.
- The shipment's here.

127
00:22:39,015 --> 00:22:41,573
- That's it, yeah?
- She's missing though.

128
00:22:41,575 --> 00:22:43,415
Keep your eyes peeled.

129
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:20,013
C'mon, let's do it.

130
00:23:20,015 --> 00:23:21,735
Faster!

131
00:23:23,615 --> 00:23:24,935
Donna Patrizia's coming.

132
00:23:34,975 --> 00:23:37,135
There, she's coming.

133
00:23:48,255 --> 00:23:50,135
Where the fuck is she?

134
00:23:52,535 --> 00:23:55,735
- She's coming in, get ready.
- Today we're gonna get rid of her ass!

135
00:24:06,895 --> 00:24:09,815
What the fuck's going on?

136
00:24:12,415 --> 00:24:14,735
Police!

137
00:24:25,575 --> 00:24:27,053
Let's go!

138
00:24:27,055 --> 00:24:28,775
Calm down!

139
00:24:31,255 --> 00:24:33,455
Shut up!

140
00:24:35,175 --> 00:24:37,175
Don't push me.

141
00:24:58,095 --> 00:24:59,615
What happened?

142
00:25:00,615 --> 00:25:03,173
They arrested Patrizia.

143
00:25:03,175 --> 00:25:05,015
What the fuck does that mean?

144
00:25:06,015 --> 00:25:09,895
The cops made a raid
and got her and the shipment.

145
00:25:12,175 --> 00:25:14,653
It's the second time it's happened.

146
00:25:14,655 --> 00:25:17,855
- People in Secondigliano...
- The fuck do I care about the people?

147
00:25:24,495 --> 00:25:26,535
Go, Fernando, I'll call you.

148
00:26:34,295 --> 00:26:36,015
What's going on?

149
00:26:41,055 --> 00:26:43,933
Why did you make me come here?

150
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,255
Patrizia's been arrested.

151
00:26:47,455 --> 00:26:48,855
What happens now?

152
00:26:54,415 --> 00:26:56,893
To us, nothing.

153
00:26:56,895 --> 00:27:00,095
You said if she went under,
she'd take us with her.

154
00:27:02,615 --> 00:27:05,375
And all this goes under, too?

155
00:27:09,935 --> 00:27:11,775
I'm handling it.

156
00:27:13,175 --> 00:27:15,173
Patrizia has no record,

157
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,975
with a good lawyer
she'll be out in a couple of days.

158
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:25,853
The TV news said they found
a hundredweight of cocaine.

159
00:27:25,855 --> 00:27:28,493
If she wants to get out now,
she just needs to talk.

160
00:27:28,495 --> 00:27:30,455
And you know that.

161
00:27:31,935 --> 00:27:33,975
A true boss never talks.

162
00:27:37,175 --> 00:27:39,215
My father never talked.

163
00:27:41,575 --> 00:27:43,895
But she's not Pietro Savastano.

164
00:27:45,015 --> 00:27:48,055
And if she decides to collaborate,
everything we've built collapses.

165
00:27:55,455 --> 00:27:58,815
Even in prison, Patrizia is
still the boss of Secondigliano.

166
00:28:00,335 --> 00:28:02,335
And she knows it.

167
00:28:13,655 --> 00:28:16,135
Santore, the cell's freed up.

168
00:28:40,095 --> 00:28:41,735
Turn right.

169
00:28:57,375 --> 00:29:00,775
Patrizia Santore, second A, cell six.

170
00:29:37,255 --> 00:29:38,695
Donna Patrizia...

171
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:44,893
To share the cell with you
is an honor and a privilege for me.

172
00:29:44,895 --> 00:29:47,855
Take the more
comfortable bed, I moved.

173
00:29:52,735 --> 00:29:56,535
- Thank you.
- No, not those.

174
00:29:58,615 --> 00:30:00,455
These are better.

175
00:30:05,175 --> 00:30:07,775
Whatever you need, I'm at your disposal.

176
00:30:09,775 --> 00:30:11,775
Got a cigarette?

177
00:30:12,895 --> 00:30:16,855
If I may say so, smoking's not good
in your condition.

178
00:30:19,415 --> 00:30:21,655
Anger's even worse.

179
00:31:03,135 --> 00:31:05,255
She's alive, Mickey.

180
00:31:08,815 --> 00:31:10,855
That's what counts.

181
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:26,455
Patrizia Santore.

182
00:31:31,135 --> 00:31:32,495
Come.

183
00:31:38,735 --> 00:31:40,695
What's happening?

184
00:32:30,495 --> 00:32:33,095
Evening, Miss Santore,
sorry it's so late.

185
00:32:38,015 --> 00:32:41,253
Did my lawyer get lost on the way?

186
00:32:41,255 --> 00:32:44,495
I thought a little chat in private
would do us good.

187
00:32:50,615 --> 00:32:51,935
Please.

188
00:33:17,255 --> 00:33:18,735
I have nothing to say.

189
00:33:21,215 --> 00:33:23,255
Then maybe I misunderstood.

190
00:33:24,615 --> 00:33:28,575
Your husband, Michelangelo Levante,
is obviously wrong.

191
00:33:30,055 --> 00:33:32,055
He told us about the shipment.

192
00:33:38,215 --> 00:33:41,813
- It's not true.
- That's what I thought, too.

193
00:33:41,815 --> 00:33:45,453
A husband reporting
his wife... impossible.

194
00:33:45,455 --> 00:33:48,693
But then he explained he feels safer
knowing you're in jail,

195
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:50,815
outside he fears for your life.

196
00:33:52,255 --> 00:33:54,133
He was really worried.

197
00:33:54,135 --> 00:33:57,373
Especially after they found
enough explosives

198
00:33:57,375 --> 00:34:00,253
to blow up the building
where you were arrested.

199
00:34:00,255 --> 00:34:03,773
I told him not to worry,
we'll keep you safe.

200
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:07,935
If you have anything to tell us,
we'll protect you, give you a new life...

201
00:34:10,255 --> 00:34:13,455
Prison's no place to raise a kid, is it?

202
00:34:15,135 --> 00:34:18,335
He told me you'd definitely
have something to say.

203
00:34:30,135 --> 00:34:31,615
All right...

204
00:34:33,095 --> 00:34:35,335
Obviously he was wrong.

205
00:34:37,535 --> 00:34:41,615
If while you think of your baby
you remember something, I'm here.

206
00:35:34,415 --> 00:35:36,335
Are you all right?

207
00:35:42,895 --> 00:35:45,215
I'm gonna be in here for a while.

208
00:35:52,575 --> 00:35:55,655
And I need a friend I can trust.

209
00:35:59,335 --> 00:36:02,855
- Are you my friend?
- I'm always at your disposal.

210
00:36:06,255 --> 00:36:07,735
Good.

211
00:36:08,935 --> 00:36:13,055
We have to let them know
I'm still in charge of Secondigliano.

212
00:36:46,255 --> 00:36:47,815
How are you?

213
00:36:53,135 --> 00:36:55,375
I didn't have any other choice.

214
00:36:57,255 --> 00:37:00,175
My family nearly blew you up.

215
00:37:04,335 --> 00:37:06,813
If it wasn't yesterday, another day,
I can't protect you two forever.

216
00:37:06,815 --> 00:37:10,935
- It wasn't up to you to choose.
- But it was.

217
00:37:12,175 --> 00:37:16,535
I chose to protect my family
and I did it the only way I knew how.

218
00:37:17,815 --> 00:37:19,975
Which family are you talking about?

219
00:37:24,175 --> 00:37:26,293
Listen to me,

220
00:37:26,295 --> 00:37:29,853
I can't do anything for you in here,
I can't protect you.

221
00:37:29,855 --> 00:37:35,255
But they won't give up,
they'll try to kill you in here too.

222
00:37:36,295 --> 00:37:38,255
You have to talk to him.

223
00:37:39,295 --> 00:37:41,655
You have to collaborate.

224
00:37:47,655 --> 00:37:49,535
I'm not a rat.

225
00:37:51,255 --> 00:37:53,335
Now get out and stay outta my sight.

226
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:56,255
You can hate me if you like...

227
00:37:57,975 --> 00:37:59,975
but you're alive.

228
00:38:02,055 --> 00:38:06,815
Now it's all in your hands,
my daughter's life, too.

229
00:38:44,775 --> 00:38:46,533
Well?

230
00:38:46,535 --> 00:38:50,893
Last night a screw took Patrizia
out of her cell.

231
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:53,213
She came back an hour later,
that's all we know.

232
00:38:53,215 --> 00:38:55,933
If she talked we'd know by now.

233
00:38:55,935 --> 00:39:00,373
Maybe she said no for now,
but they find ways to tempt you.

234
00:39:00,375 --> 00:39:05,335
The time's come to let Patrizia know
she's not alone.

235
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:21,535
Let's go for a walk.

236
00:39:44,415 --> 00:39:46,493
You gotta do this,

237
00:39:46,495 --> 00:39:49,893
and make sure no one comes
from the other side.

238
00:39:49,895 --> 00:39:51,495
In the soup...

239
00:41:03,255 --> 00:41:07,293
Only by helping
the Levantes can we solve

240
00:41:07,295 --> 00:41:10,055
our families' problems, don't you see?

241
00:41:11,055 --> 00:41:12,655
Do what you gotta do.

242
00:41:23,855 --> 00:41:26,215
Patrizia met with Ruggieri.

243
00:41:39,175 --> 00:41:40,935
Is she going to collaborate?

244
00:41:42,415 --> 00:41:44,015
I don't know.

245
00:41:45,335 --> 00:41:46,935
Yes, you do.

246
00:41:49,255 --> 00:41:52,015
Gennaro, I've thought this through.

247
00:41:53,855 --> 00:41:57,255
She has every reason in the world
to talk, about the past too.

248
00:41:59,375 --> 00:42:03,213
I always helped her,
I put my realm in her hands.

249
00:42:03,215 --> 00:42:08,093
Gratitude doesn't count for fuck,
when you're desperate

250
00:42:08,095 --> 00:42:11,215
and when all you have to think
about is your kid's life.

251
00:42:14,775 --> 00:42:17,773
I know that,

252
00:42:17,775 --> 00:42:20,175
because I would have done
the same thing.

253
00:42:21,575 --> 00:42:23,973
But I can't let her

254
00:42:23,975 --> 00:42:27,615
destroy all our work,
all we've accomplished so far.

255
00:42:34,975 --> 00:42:37,215
She has to die.

256
00:42:43,255 --> 00:42:45,693
I told Fernando to get her a message.

257
00:42:45,695 --> 00:42:48,573
We got people in that prison.

258
00:42:48,575 --> 00:42:50,655
To put her mind at rest.

259
00:43:14,095 --> 00:43:16,455
Don't let her outta your sight.

260
00:43:34,415 --> 00:43:36,133
She's going alone.

261
00:43:36,135 --> 00:43:38,255
Let's go, without being seen.

262
00:44:39,775 --> 00:44:43,575
Sorry, Nunzia, but there was
another way to help my family.

263
00:44:47,335 --> 00:44:49,055
What did you think you were doing?

264
00:44:54,895 --> 00:44:56,775
Fucking bitch!

265
00:45:18,055 --> 00:45:20,135
Donna Patrizia, are you all right?

266
00:45:26,135 --> 00:45:30,175
Get help. Hurry!

267
00:46:26,057 --> 00:46:31,057
