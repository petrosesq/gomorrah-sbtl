<i>In the Bay of Naples, a few kilometers
from Pompeii and Vesuvius,</i>

3
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,918
<i>lies the world's most surprising
underwater archeological site.</i>

4
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,360
<i>Here is the lost Roman city of Baia.</i>

5
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,118
<i>Since the first century BC
it has been an exclusive place...</i>

6
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:52,240
See the lovely parmigiana
Mom made for you?

7
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:06,720
Patrizia, will you tell me
what's the matter?

8
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,600
Last night I saw
a documentary about bees.

9
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,760
The males do nothing
from morning till night.

10
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,560
They only wake up
when the Queen sends for them.

11
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,520
They mate in flight for safety.

12
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,160
And they fuck so much
that their balls explode.

13
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,160
And then they die.

14
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,078
One after another,

15
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,000
'cause they're no good
for anything anymore.

16
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:02,800
That's all they can do.

17
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:16,878
From the samples you brought from Milan,
I see you do elegant stuff.

18
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,920
What's the retail price? 1,200?

19
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,160
You sell them to retailers at 500 max.

20
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,238
Once you buy fabric,
pay seamstresses, packing, shipping,

21
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,360
you're left with 10%, right?

22
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,878
Right.

23
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,280
Go with us
and your earnings will triple.

24
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,278
And how?

25
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,918
Our labor costs are low:
two or three euros an hour.

26
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,760
It depends what their work's like.

27
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,838
You only have to decide, Evelina.

28
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,318
You can work with subcontractors
in your area that cost more

29
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,878
and won't do an hour of overtime
for love or money,

30
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,880
or you can make real money with us.

31
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,398
- The paper pattern?
- I only have them for the samples.

32
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,158
- You'll do patterns and size-charts.
- No problem... Fabric?

33
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,600
I'll courier it all to you tomorrow.

34
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,760
- Dad, I got A in math!
- Well done!

35
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,558
What's the matter?

36
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,438
- You take a bath in perfume?
- You don't like it?

37
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,600
I like it, on a woman, though.

38
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,640
Let's go wash our hands,
dinner is ready.

39
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,360
Well done, Daddy's little scholar.

40
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,758
How did the checkup go?
Is the baby growing?

41
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,000
- Everything's good.
- And Patrizia?

42
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,680
She decided to have a rest.

43
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,440
Good, if only
she'd give it a rest for real.

44
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,198
What's happening
in Central Naples is no good,

45
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,440
and if the problem spreads
it'll weaken Secondigliano.

46
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,198
And to keep helping a weak clan

47
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,520
is too risky.

48
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:50,078
I don't think Patrizia's fit
to rule right now.

49
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,720
You're her husband,
make her see reason.

50
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,998
Now she has two options:

51
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,438
be a woman or a commander.

52
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,318
I'd like to know
what it is that you want,

53
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,798
if you want to raise a kid

54
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,240
or you want to mourn your wife.

55
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,278
Now let's eat, I'm starved.

56
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:22,518
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

57
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,958
Lord, bless this food.

58
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,438
Our Father...

59
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:30,520
Who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name...

60
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,160
The Levantes are behind the bust.

61
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:04,120
They want to take Secondigliano.

62
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,160
They blamed Nicola and killed him.

63
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,678
Now they're hand in hand
with the Graduate,

64
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:16,160
who took everything
that was Blue Blood's.

65
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,120
My husband's one of them, Gennaro.

66
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,600
And you didn't notice
anything, Patrizia?

67
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,278
I told you: a boss can never
trust anyone.

68
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,080
- I know.
- Doesn't look like it.

69
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,480
What are you going to do?

70
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,918
I can only do two things.

71
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,400
Be a wife and mother and leave
everything to the Levantes.

72
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,800
Or I wipe out every last one of them.

73
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,080
I handed over a kingdom to you.

74
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,920
Mine, the Savastanos'.

75
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,398
And you're still here
asking me which way to go.

76
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,280
No, Gennaro.

77
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,680
You're wrong.

78
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,400
I just wanted you to know.

79
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,160
This is my house.

80
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,120
And in my house I call the shots.

81
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:39,398
OUR BROTHERS

82
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,278
You're nuts coming here.

83
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:45,118
You know the Capaccios
run Forcella now.

84
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,640
Since you killed his brother,
the Graduate's looking all over for you.

85
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,880
I could have put it here for you.

86
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,840
I'm the one who needs to be pardoned.

87
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,438
I know what you're risking,
Pure'n'Simple,

88
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,920
but you gotta set up a meeting
for me with our most trusted guys.

89
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,080
You got it.

90
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,080
How do you feel?

91
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,600
I managed to get some rest.

92
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,878
I had to make a decision
before talking to you.

93
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,480
And I've made it.

94
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,920
I have to think about
our Bianca first.

95
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,240
It's best if I hand over the command
of Secondigliano to you.

96
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,520
Bianca?

97
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,360
That was my mother's name.

98
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,880
We'll do whatever you want, sweetheart.

99
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:01,480
This place is like a jail.

100
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:07,320
But if Patrizia hadn't given us
a crash pad, by now we'd be dead.

101
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,720
I don't want to mourn you.

102
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,720
I can't stop now.

103
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,600
First I gotta avenge our brothers.

104
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,360
You building a tower?

105
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,478
Things aren't going well, Azzurra.

106
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,598
Secondigliano's about to blow up.

107
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,400
- That's not our problem.
- Yes, it is.

108
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:18,600
When things are going well,
we're all friends.

109
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,398
But when things get outta balance,

110
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,160
who knows what could happen.

111
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:34,838
You put Patrizia there, for a reason:

112
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,520
to buy us our freedom.

113
00:18:20,425 --> 00:18:24,383
I hadn't heard the news.
Congratulations.

114
00:18:24,385 --> 00:18:27,825
- Thank you. So, how are things?
- Good.

115
00:18:31,705 --> 00:18:35,385
Igor, for the moment, I can't
personally handle the shipments.

116
00:18:36,425 --> 00:18:39,505
My husband Michelangelo
will handle them.

117
00:18:44,705 --> 00:18:47,025
Talk to him like you talk to me.

118
00:19:46,945 --> 00:19:48,305
One.

119
00:19:53,465 --> 00:19:55,065
One.

120
00:20:00,545 --> 00:20:02,225
Gimme twenty.

121
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:34,785
Morning, Don Michelangelo. Please.

122
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:25,223
We're done here, Donna Patrizia.
It's 213 grand.

123
00:21:25,225 --> 00:21:28,385
In line with last week,
maybe a bit more.

124
00:21:43,625 --> 00:21:45,905
This isn't a neighborhood.

125
00:21:47,745 --> 00:21:50,105
It's a city within a bigger city.

126
00:21:52,985 --> 00:21:55,865
Secondigliano doesn't answer to anyone.

127
00:22:01,185 --> 00:22:03,345
Enzo came to me.

128
00:22:06,385 --> 00:22:08,385
He loathes everyone.

129
00:22:09,825 --> 00:22:13,023
He says that your family's
behind the bust

130
00:22:13,025 --> 00:22:14,745
and now he asks for my help.

131
00:22:17,345 --> 00:22:19,625
He wants to kill you all.

132
00:22:21,065 --> 00:22:23,385
Why didn't you tell me straightaway?

133
00:22:24,545 --> 00:22:26,545
Because I had doubts.

134
00:22:28,345 --> 00:22:30,025
About me?

135
00:22:31,625 --> 00:22:33,265
Yeah.

136
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,305
And now it's gone?

137
00:22:42,345 --> 00:22:44,345
No.

138
00:22:50,105 --> 00:22:52,225
But I've made a choice.

139
00:22:55,265 --> 00:22:57,265
Enzo's here...

140
00:22:59,265 --> 00:23:01,505
But you gotta make me a promise.

141
00:23:02,865 --> 00:23:08,425
You gotta make a choice,
like I did, and remove all doubt.

142
00:23:58,665 --> 00:24:00,625
Enzo...

143
00:24:04,305 --> 00:24:06,105
What have you done, bro'?

144
00:24:12,545 --> 00:24:15,065
Check out the hair.

145
00:24:17,105 --> 00:24:19,145
Hey, Enzo.

146
00:24:25,305 --> 00:24:27,185
I'm glad to see you.

147
00:24:44,105 --> 00:24:48,425
Patrizia and I have
the same enemy: the Levantes.

148
00:24:50,065 --> 00:24:52,783
First they used
the Capaccios like puppets,

149
00:24:52,785 --> 00:24:55,303
then they took our turf.

150
00:24:55,305 --> 00:24:57,545
We gotta hide to talk.

151
00:24:59,785 --> 00:25:02,343
They better not think
I've forgotten them.

152
00:25:02,345 --> 00:25:04,625
I think about them all the time.

153
00:25:08,825 --> 00:25:10,545
Night and day...

154
00:25:12,785 --> 00:25:14,625
All the time.

155
00:25:16,505 --> 00:25:18,945
What do you got in mind, Enzo?

156
00:26:06,905 --> 00:26:09,385
Patrizia just wants to be a mom.

157
00:26:11,825 --> 00:26:14,105
She's made up her mind.

158
00:26:15,905 --> 00:26:18,743
And she's handed everything over to me.

159
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:20,745
Shipping, dealing spots...

160
00:26:21,905 --> 00:26:23,305
Secondigliano.

161
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:31,825
She handed it over to me, Dad,
not to you.

162
00:26:42,785 --> 00:26:45,105
You never liked this place.

163
00:26:46,665 --> 00:26:51,465
You never came here to work,
but our family's fortune starts here.

164
00:26:56,145 --> 00:26:57,825
Michelangelo...

165
00:27:02,945 --> 00:27:05,623
To make concrete

166
00:27:05,625 --> 00:27:08,185
you need to mix sand with cement.

167
00:27:09,665 --> 00:27:13,983
And what comes out is a new substance,

168
00:27:13,985 --> 00:27:16,303
that belongs to us,

169
00:27:16,305 --> 00:27:18,705
it belongs to our family.

170
00:27:21,345 --> 00:27:25,225
You and Patrizia are like
sand and cement.

171
00:27:29,065 --> 00:27:34,625
You've become a substance
that can build something very big.

172
00:27:36,185 --> 00:27:40,665
And if you understand it,
so does she.

173
00:27:42,745 --> 00:27:44,585
You're right, Dad.

174
00:27:47,105 --> 00:27:49,545
There's something else
we have to settle.

175
00:27:51,025 --> 00:27:53,185
We have to kill Blue Blood.

176
00:28:44,145 --> 00:28:48,025
- Well?
- It's good, I like it.

177
00:29:58,665 --> 00:30:00,583
Thanks for coming, guys.

178
00:30:00,585 --> 00:30:03,225
They told us you'd retired.

179
00:30:12,345 --> 00:30:15,663
Maybe it's time for me
to get back to work.

180
00:30:15,665 --> 00:30:18,625
We missed you, Don Gennaro.

181
00:30:21,185 --> 00:30:22,905
Let's go.

182
00:31:30,025 --> 00:31:31,545
Go, go!

183
00:31:39,305 --> 00:31:41,065
There's no one here.

184
00:31:46,945 --> 00:31:49,345
Run, it's a trap! Sons of bitches!

185
00:34:49,185 --> 00:34:50,863
You pieces of shit!

186
00:34:50,865 --> 00:34:53,105
Guys, after him!

187
00:35:42,985 --> 00:35:44,465
Mom?

188
00:35:45,865 --> 00:35:48,905
I'm fine, why? What's happened?

189
00:35:50,665 --> 00:35:52,345
Calm down, Mom.

190
00:35:54,305 --> 00:35:56,105
What are you saying?

191
00:35:57,225 --> 00:35:59,065
And how are they?

192
00:36:00,705 --> 00:36:02,785
The main thing is that they're okay.

193
00:36:05,465 --> 00:36:07,225
I'll be right there.

194
00:36:14,985 --> 00:36:16,705
We failed.

195
00:37:41,705 --> 00:37:43,865
Good evening, Don Gennaro.

196
00:37:48,465 --> 00:37:52,183
Mistral's sorry,
but he couldn't come to the meeting.

197
00:37:52,185 --> 00:37:54,745
- He sent his regards.
- Don't worry about it.

198
00:37:55,905 --> 00:37:59,345
I know what it means
to live on high alert.

199
00:38:03,665 --> 00:38:06,903
With all due respect,

200
00:38:06,905 --> 00:38:10,503
we thought you'd retired
from our business.

201
00:38:10,505 --> 00:38:13,023
Or am I wrong?

202
00:38:13,025 --> 00:38:15,743
It's true.

203
00:38:15,745 --> 00:38:18,745
But now I've got money,
contacts and skills.

204
00:38:20,025 --> 00:38:23,545
Above all, I need to take back
everything that's mine.

205
00:38:26,985 --> 00:38:29,185
Excuse me, if you'll allow me...

206
00:38:33,065 --> 00:38:36,665
Can I ask you something Mistral
would have asked for sure?

207
00:38:39,105 --> 00:38:41,025
Go ahead.

208
00:38:42,305 --> 00:38:44,825
Why did you choose him?

209
00:38:46,905 --> 00:38:50,065
The next war's gonna be long and hard.

210
00:38:51,985 --> 00:38:55,543
And a man who had the guts to eat
his enemy's heart in prison

211
00:38:55,545 --> 00:38:57,385
is a man who'll do anything.

212
00:38:58,465 --> 00:39:01,705
And I need someone like that
to win this war.

213
00:39:03,065 --> 00:39:05,265
But that's water under the bridge.

214
00:39:06,665 --> 00:39:09,983
After that, he did 20 years
of maximum security

215
00:39:09,985 --> 00:39:13,625
and his friends all turned
their backs on him.

216
00:39:20,425 --> 00:39:22,305
I know.

217
00:39:25,065 --> 00:39:30,383
But I also know that he once had
enormous ambition

218
00:39:30,385 --> 00:39:33,385
and that's something that never dies.

219
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:48,750
