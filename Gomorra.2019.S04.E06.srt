2
00:02:14,995 --> 00:02:17,435
What's the matter, Patrizia?

3
00:02:20,435 --> 00:02:25,033
Nothing.
I'm sad you're leaving.

4
00:02:25,035 --> 00:02:29,113
I won't be away long,
I have to run an errand in Modena.

5
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:31,915
- My father ordered me to do it.
- I know.

6
00:02:36,395 --> 00:02:39,155
Are you sure that's all it is?

7
00:02:43,155 --> 00:02:45,913
I'm scared they want to fuck me over.

8
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,275
Who?

9
00:02:49,155 --> 00:02:50,875
I don't know.

10
00:02:53,235 --> 00:02:56,275
Nicola was one of the few
who knew about the shipment.

11
00:02:58,075 --> 00:03:00,115
Do you think it was him?

12
00:03:02,595 --> 00:03:04,475
I can't believe it.

13
00:03:06,995 --> 00:03:11,033
To get the cops mixed up in it,
you need to know people.

14
00:03:11,035 --> 00:03:13,155
You need to be powerful.

15
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:21,315
Who else knew about the shipment?

16
00:03:26,195 --> 00:03:28,075
All the allied families.

17
00:03:34,555 --> 00:03:37,155
It's going to be all right, just relax.

18
00:03:40,555 --> 00:03:45,073
But do me a favor: stay at home
for the next few days, while I'm away.

19
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:47,513
I'll feel easier if you did.

20
00:03:47,515 --> 00:03:49,795
- I'll go get ready.
- Okay.

21
00:04:40,555 --> 00:04:43,433
- Well?
- They're not talking about this raid.

22
00:04:43,435 --> 00:04:45,593
I only heard one thing.

23
00:04:45,595 --> 00:04:48,953
- But it's a rumor.
- Spit it out, I'll pay you.

24
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:52,593
- Not all the drugs made it to storage.
- What?

25
00:04:52,595 --> 00:04:55,073
A big whack of it
has gone back onto the street.

26
00:04:55,075 --> 00:04:57,633
How do I get to it?

27
00:04:57,635 --> 00:04:59,635
Call this number.

28
00:05:49,475 --> 00:05:51,315
Mamma.

29
00:05:55,795 --> 00:05:58,873
- How do you feel?
- I'm fine, don't worry.

30
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:02,233
- You've taken your medication?
- Yes, sir, don't worry.

31
00:06:02,235 --> 00:06:05,273
- Which did you take?
- That one...

32
00:06:05,275 --> 00:06:08,913
The one with the red cap,
with the English name.

33
00:06:08,915 --> 00:06:10,793
Did you taken the bleomycin?

34
00:06:10,795 --> 00:06:13,713
I have a doctor in the house
and I never knew it!

35
00:06:13,715 --> 00:06:16,433
You have to take it three times a day:

36
00:06:16,435 --> 00:06:20,753
morning, afternoon and night.

37
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:24,755
Here. Hold out your hand.

38
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,473
There you go.

39
00:06:27,475 --> 00:06:29,073
Uncle.

40
00:06:29,075 --> 00:06:32,793
Paoletto has to get his vaccination
shot, I have to go to school.

41
00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:35,635
- Where's your mamma?
- Sleeping, should I wake her?

42
00:06:37,515 --> 00:06:39,235
I'll do it.

43
00:06:43,955 --> 00:06:46,075
It's Linuccio, go let him in.

44
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:54,233
Get up. It's late.

45
00:06:54,235 --> 00:06:57,393
- Serena, get up.
- Cut it out, Nicola.

46
00:06:57,395 --> 00:06:59,873
Paoletto needs his vaccination.

47
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:02,793
And here he is... I'll do what I want.

48
00:07:02,795 --> 00:07:05,553
My ass! Get up!
I'll give you two minutes.

49
00:07:05,555 --> 00:07:08,553
- Go away, get out!
- I'll break your legs, get up!

50
00:07:08,555 --> 00:07:09,995
Fuck off!

51
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,913
The situation's not good.

52
00:07:15,915 --> 00:07:18,353
The seized drugs
are back into circulation.

53
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:22,515
Whoever's behind this
is very powerful, he owns some cops.

54
00:07:24,835 --> 00:07:28,033
What are you gonna do?

55
00:07:28,035 --> 00:07:31,473
It was you and me in there,
we're the only ones who got out.

56
00:07:31,475 --> 00:07:35,353
She thinks it was me
and so she suspects you, too.

57
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:39,113
We gotta figure out who it was,
we gotta bring her proof.

58
00:07:39,115 --> 00:07:42,955
That's the only way we can sleep easy,
us and our families.

59
00:07:46,515 --> 00:07:48,075
So?

60
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,315
What are we gonna do?

61
00:07:53,755 --> 00:07:55,875
I got a contact.

62
00:07:57,515 --> 00:07:59,755
We gotta go today.

63
00:08:07,235 --> 00:08:08,995
Hi, Serena.

64
00:08:56,955 --> 00:09:00,115
We wanna see Kevin,
we need to talk to him.

65
00:09:01,675 --> 00:09:03,593
- Are you Nicola?
- Yeah.

66
00:09:03,595 --> 00:09:05,315
- And him?
- He's my cousin.

67
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:09,793
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

68
00:09:09,795 --> 00:09:11,475
Come.

69
00:09:42,875 --> 00:09:44,593
Know who that is?

70
00:09:44,595 --> 00:09:47,193
That's Mister Antonio,
an ex-traffic cop.

71
00:09:47,195 --> 00:09:50,673
He began doing our accounts
and later he left his wife.

72
00:09:50,675 --> 00:09:52,713
Just think!

73
00:09:52,715 --> 00:09:57,273
Bro', people shoot their mouths off,
but everyone likes cocaine.

74
00:09:57,275 --> 00:10:00,315
And black pussy!

75
00:10:12,466 --> 00:10:14,333
It's all good, it's all good.

76
00:10:14,335 --> 00:10:15,295
They're with me.

77
00:11:36,845 --> 00:11:38,430
Greetings, Papa Gyan.

78
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:40,049
These are the friends
I talked to you about.

79
00:12:21,435 --> 00:12:24,713
We'll take a kilo, to start.

80
00:12:24,715 --> 00:12:27,875
Obviously we'll pay in cash
and you name the price.

81
00:12:37,155 --> 00:12:38,633
What did he say?

82
00:12:38,635 --> 00:12:41,073
He said it's all good,
but he has a question.

83
00:12:41,075 --> 00:12:44,833
- You're from Secondigliano, right?
- Right.

84
00:12:44,835 --> 00:12:49,273
How come you want coke from us?
Yours is better.

85
00:12:49,275 --> 00:12:51,993
Or has something happened
that we don't know about?

86
00:12:51,995 --> 00:12:55,475
I'm fed up, I want to make
some money on my own.

87
00:13:01,275 --> 00:13:03,435
Tell him he can trust me.

88
00:13:04,635 --> 00:13:06,553
We'll start like this,

89
00:13:06,555 --> 00:13:08,913
then when you know we have the money

90
00:13:08,915 --> 00:13:11,353
you can introduce us
to whoever sold it to you,

91
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:14,195
and we can do
some good business together.

92
00:13:23,835 --> 00:13:26,795
Obviously we'll pay you
for your trouble.

93
00:13:45,475 --> 00:13:46,795
We'll let you know.

94
00:13:51,629 --> 00:13:53,913
Papa Gyan, with all due respect.

95
00:13:53,915 --> 00:13:55,715
Guys, let's go.

96
00:15:02,955 --> 00:15:05,115
What brings you to Forcella?

97
00:15:06,195 --> 00:15:09,713
I heard something
that might interest you.

98
00:15:09,715 --> 00:15:11,115
What is it?

99
00:15:12,395 --> 00:15:15,435
The cocaine from the raid
is back on the streets.

100
00:15:19,715 --> 00:15:23,273
- How's that possible?
- I'm trying to figure it out.

101
00:15:23,275 --> 00:15:26,793
So, why didn't your boss come
and tell us directly?

102
00:15:26,795 --> 00:15:29,633
Because things are going badly for us

103
00:15:29,635 --> 00:15:33,433
and I don't want Patrizia to think
I wanna fuck her over.

104
00:15:33,435 --> 00:15:36,715
If what I think is true,
there's someone behind it.

105
00:15:37,995 --> 00:15:41,313
- Who do you think it is?
- I'm thinking someone big.

106
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,795
Someone who doesn't want
this alliance anymore.

107
00:15:45,195 --> 00:15:48,873
Us, together,

108
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,633
we gotta stop him.

109
00:15:51,635 --> 00:15:55,313
As far as I can tell,
the problem's yours.

110
00:15:55,315 --> 00:15:58,075
- Not ours.
- That's true.

111
00:15:59,795 --> 00:16:04,353
But what happens to me today,
could happen to you tomorrow.

112
00:16:04,355 --> 00:16:06,875
When it happens to us,
we'll take care of it.

113
00:16:08,315 --> 00:16:10,035
Don't worry.

114
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:33,713
What's wrong, Valerio?

115
00:16:33,715 --> 00:16:36,795
- You got a problem?
- No, no problem.

116
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:40,915
Even though you don't say it,
I know what you think.

117
00:16:42,395 --> 00:16:45,553
Then, you also know where we stand.

118
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:48,313
Selling pills to kids to get by.

119
00:16:48,315 --> 00:16:51,393
- We'll wait for Patrizia's shipment.
- It won't be long.

120
00:16:51,395 --> 00:16:55,595
- That's what she said.
- What do you mean? I don't get you.

121
00:16:58,115 --> 00:17:00,995
The raid's been harmful for us, too.

122
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:05,395
What if Nicola's right?
If there's someone behind it?

123
00:17:11,355 --> 00:17:14,873
There was an emperor
called Julius Caesar.

124
00:17:14,875 --> 00:17:17,433
Know what he said?

125
00:17:17,435 --> 00:17:21,155
When your enemy's after you,
you have to be one step ahead.

126
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,755
Tell me something, Valerio.

127
00:17:34,955 --> 00:17:38,955
Did the emperor have a <i>consigliori</i>
who wanted to take his place?

128
00:17:40,115 --> 00:17:44,313
Because maybe Nicola wants
to swipe Patrizia's place.

129
00:17:44,315 --> 00:17:48,115
- Let's tell Patrizia.
- We'll mind our own fucking business!

130
00:17:56,355 --> 00:17:58,915
You still don't get how it works here.

131
00:18:01,155 --> 00:18:04,913
You gotta mind your own business
and keep your head down.

132
00:18:04,915 --> 00:18:06,955
You can't trust anyone.

133
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,395
Enzo...

134
00:18:12,715 --> 00:18:15,835
When I met you
I saw something in you...

135
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:19,955
but I don't see it anymore.

136
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,230
Kevin?

137
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:05,228
We don't need time,
I got the money already.

138
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,230
Cool, I'll see you tonight.

139
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,748
We're doing the handover.

140
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:13,108
He got the name
of who sold them the coke?

141
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,268
- Yes, but he wants 10 grand more.
- We gotta negotiate.

142
00:19:16,270 --> 00:19:19,868
This money's peanuts,
surely our life's worth 10 grand.

143
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:21,870
You trust them?

144
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:26,430
Come up, Lino.

145
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,270
Good morning.

146
00:19:38,590 --> 00:19:40,308
- How much is it?
- 35.

147
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:41,868
You made less this week?

148
00:19:41,870 --> 00:19:45,110
If you come on Thursday
and not Saturday, it's obvious.

149
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:49,030
Goodbye.

150
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:03,188
When Patrizia finds out
we took Berlingeri's money...

151
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:06,548
When she finds out who wants
to screw her, she won't mind.

152
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:10,068
And if it doesn't go like you say?
If it goes wrong?

153
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:14,228
Why don't we talk to Patrizia?
We'll explain it all to her.

154
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:16,948
- She'll understand.
- Lino...

155
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:19,468
We have to bring Patrizia a name.

156
00:20:19,470 --> 00:20:22,510
We need to figure out who it was,
trust me.

157
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:25,430
It's all good.

158
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:29,190
It's you and me, we'll cream them!

159
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,708
All done?

160
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,508
Very good...

161
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,788
Good, huh?

162
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,630
- Almost like in Naples.
- Let's say that...

163
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,908
What are you doing here?
I'm working.

164
00:21:07,910 --> 00:21:10,870
- I don't want to see you anymore.
- I'm pregnant.

165
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,270
And what do you want from me?

166
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:28,830
I need to ask something
only you can tell me.

167
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,470
What kind of mother would I be?

168
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:40,590
The worst in the world.

169
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,230
You smell like Mamma's hair.

170
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:10,350
- You still remember it?
- I can't forget it.

171
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:16,510
Alessio, what should I do?

172
00:22:17,630 --> 00:22:21,150
If the kid's going to end up like us,
forget about it.

173
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:44,110
Nicola!

174
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,990
Lino!

175
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:10,548
- You found us.
- Pieces of shit! What have you done?

176
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:12,228
- Shut up.
- You're shit!

177
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:14,548
Shut up or I'll shoot you in the mouth!

178
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:17,188
- So shoot me!
- Shut the fuck up.

179
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:22,228
- Shoot!
- We need you alive.

180
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,788
Now listen to me good.

181
00:24:24,790 --> 00:24:29,668
Your boss is a whore, she's not capable
of running the alliance.

182
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:32,108
A woman can't be in charge
of Secondigliano,

183
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:34,150
you need to take her place.

184
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:40,190
Or we'll tell Patrizia that you were
behind the raid and we'll kill you.

185
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:44,030
What do you say?

186
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:53,710
We don't want this,
we want you to be okay.

187
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,108
Nicola, think about your family.

188
00:24:59,110 --> 00:25:01,468
Your mamma, your sister.

189
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:05,028
That sweet little niece of yours,
she's so cute.

190
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:11,468
Your women need peace of mind,
they need a secure future.

191
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,948
Or not?

192
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:16,190
Beat it.

193
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:25,870
Nicola...
We got an offer for you.

194
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:33,228
You kill Patrizia

195
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:35,630
and take back what's yours.

196
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:35,828
- Where were you?
- What do you want from me?

197
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:37,868
Didn't mamma tell you not to go out?

198
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:41,550
- I went for a walk.
- Get in there.

199
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:46,028
Serena, you need to stay here,
full stop.

200
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:49,068
Who the fuck are you
to tell me what I can do?

201
00:27:49,070 --> 00:27:52,468
Don't you get it,
we got a big fucking problem?

202
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,108
How can I make you get it?

203
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,788
What's your problem, Nicola?

204
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:58,628
You think only you got problems?

205
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:02,228
If you'd talk once in a while
we could find a solution.

206
00:28:02,230 --> 00:28:05,308
What's your big fucking problem, Nicola?

207
00:28:05,310 --> 00:28:08,308
The kids are asleep, are you crazy?

208
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:10,108
No one was supposed to go out.

209
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:12,548
I told her, but you know
what your sister's like.

210
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:17,428
- I sure do.
- Well done. Well done.

211
00:28:17,430 --> 00:28:21,550
You always take his side.
I'm always the bad one.

212
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:28,108
Go back to bed, Mamma.

213
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:30,870
Go.

214
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:54,028
- Can I go to my friends?
- Sure, off you go.

215
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:55,870
You, go slow!

216
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:05,270
Your aunt called.

217
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,190
She said Lino's missing.

218
00:29:11,470 --> 00:29:15,110
- Do you know where Lino is?
- No, I don't know.

219
00:29:16,470 --> 00:29:21,308
He didn't come home last night,
he didn't even call.

220
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,510
She's worried.

221
00:29:24,590 --> 00:29:27,150
- You don't know anything?
- No, Mamma.

222
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:35,550
- What's going on?
- What you said, Lino's missing.

223
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,710
Hello?

224
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,990
Where?

225
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:59,990
See you there tonight.

226
00:30:07,190 --> 00:30:09,230
I gotta go, Ma.

227
00:30:13,830 --> 00:30:16,030
Be careful.

228
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:49,110
- Grazia.
- Mickey.

229
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:51,990
Can you hear me?

230
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:55,748
Something bad's going down.

231
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:58,630
I can't explain now,
you gotta come back now.

232
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:00,190
Well?

233
00:33:01,470 --> 00:33:03,390
You thought it over?

234
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:08,230
And what did you think?

235
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:15,470
If I wasn't forced to, I'd never do it.

236
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:19,390
But Patrizia isn't family.

237
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:26,348
Whereas Michelangelo is your brother.
Have you thought this through?

238
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:29,628
If you really care about someone,

239
00:33:29,630 --> 00:33:31,830
you gotta be prepared to do anything.

240
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:35,870
Even hurt them
if it's for their own good.

241
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,710
I hope he feels the same way.

242
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:43,428
But that's your business.

243
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:45,948
As for what I gotta do, I'm ready.

244
00:33:45,950 --> 00:33:47,630
- When?
- Tomorrow.

245
00:33:49,590 --> 00:33:52,070
So tomorrow we'll be fucking rid of her.

246
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,590
And after
we'll all drink a toast together.

247
00:34:02,230 --> 00:34:03,910
You can go now.

248
00:34:24,870 --> 00:34:26,510
You just come in like that?

249
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,028
We're not kids anymore.

250
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:32,670
Come with me,
I wanna show you something.

251
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:38,670
- Serena...
- It's important.

252
00:34:57,510 --> 00:34:59,788
What's all this money?

253
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:02,988
I've been saving it up all this time.

254
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:06,868
If I don't come back,
you know where it is.

255
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:10,110
Why wouldn't you come back,
where are you going?

256
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,590
Nicola!

257
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,828
Serena...

258
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:25,508
Whatever happens,

259
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:27,430
you gotta take care of them.

260
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:33,310
You gotta promise me.

261
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,990
I promise.

262
00:36:39,110 --> 00:36:40,550
Nicola!

263
00:36:45,430 --> 00:36:47,390
Can I talk to you for a minute?

264
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:51,190
I know everything.

265
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:56,708
- I didn't have any choice.
- I know.

266
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:59,990
We'll take care of it,
but you have to trust me.

267
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:06,350
Give me your gun.
Nicola, trust me.

268
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,750
Give me the gun.

269
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,070
Come with me.

270
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,950
You're my brothers.

271
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:21,748
- You're my brothers!
- Calm down.

272
00:38:21,750 --> 00:38:24,548
Calm down?
What the fuck are you doing?

273
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:28,068
- Papa told us to.
- He said not to get you involved.

274
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,108
And you do what he says?

275
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,108
What the fuck's going on?

276
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,468
These two wanted to do things
without telling me

277
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:38,868
and they wanted to frame you.

278
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:41,188
What are you going to do now?

279
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:43,270
How do you wanna fix this?

280
00:38:44,270 --> 00:38:48,830
You wanna talk to Patrizia?
And we go out with the guilty party?

281
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,470
Michelangelo...

282
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:56,790
Are you with us or against us?

283
00:39:58,070 --> 00:39:59,630
Why are you here?

284
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:07,268
- What happened?
- You were right.

285
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,030
It was Nicola.

286
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:12,830
How do you know?

287
00:40:14,350 --> 00:40:17,190
He suggested a deal to my brothers.

288
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:20,668
Why would he do that?

289
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:22,950
He wanted to take your place.

290
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:30,390
That's why I came back.

291
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:34,790
I did it for you, I took care of you.

292
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:53,310
I'm expecting your child.

293
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,910
Papa.

294
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,830
It's wrong...

295
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:18,228
It's wrong having a favorite child.

296
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,510
It's wrong.

297
00:42:23,830 --> 00:42:27,710
I've always loved all my other kids,
all the same.

298
00:42:28,910 --> 00:42:30,470
But not you...

299
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:33,228
No.

300
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:36,308
You were something else.

301
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:39,708
From the first moment,

302
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:42,628
I loved you so much.

303
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:44,788
So much.

304
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:46,350
Too much.

305
00:42:54,350 --> 00:43:00,828
So why did you do what you did to me?
Tell me, I don't get it.

306
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:04,228
Because a delicate plant dies...

307
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:07,588
It dies if you put it in the wrong soil.

308
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:09,830
This plant isn't dead.

309
00:43:11,070 --> 00:43:15,908
Actually, it's sprouted.
It's borne fruit.

310
00:43:15,910 --> 00:43:18,030
Patrizia's having my baby.

311
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:22,310
It's your blood, we're a family now.

312
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:32,630
Well, if that's the way it is, go!

313
00:43:34,510 --> 00:43:36,590
You have my blessing.

314
00:45:00,598 --> 00:45:05,598
