00:01:55,735 --> 00:01:59,813
- Enzo! Glad you came.
- Congratulations.

3
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:02,093
Thank you. Come.

4
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:04,575
- Hi, Rosa.
- Hi, Enzo.

5
00:02:05,775 --> 00:02:07,293
He's beautiful.

6
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:10,493
He doesn't look like you at all,
good thing he took after Rosa.

7
00:02:10,495 --> 00:02:12,653
Good thing, for real!

8
00:02:12,655 --> 00:02:15,453
Enzo, I'm going to get the party favors.

9
00:02:15,455 --> 00:02:18,573
We gotta celebrate something else
and we gotta hurry.

10
00:02:18,575 --> 00:02:21,933
- The first one to become a dad?
- No, when the drugs arrive.

11
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:24,253
When and if they arrive.

12
00:02:24,255 --> 00:02:27,773
- Do you know?
- Patrizia said a month, it's up.

13
00:02:27,775 --> 00:02:30,973
But the fucking Capaccios
bought stuff on their own

14
00:02:30,975 --> 00:02:32,973
and they're expanding
behind our backs.

15
00:02:32,975 --> 00:02:35,973
Wait 'til the stuff gets here
then we'll be laughing again.

16
00:02:35,975 --> 00:02:37,933
What's there to laugh about?

17
00:02:37,935 --> 00:02:41,133
The problem's not
that there's no drugs, but why.

18
00:02:41,135 --> 00:02:44,733
Secondigliano's in the shit,
they even had a rat in the house.

19
00:02:44,735 --> 00:02:48,373
- What if nothing turns up?
- What do you think, Valerio?

20
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:50,813
Unfortunately, it's not up to me.

21
00:02:50,815 --> 00:02:53,295
Enzo...

22
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,653
Why the long faces?

23
00:02:56,655 --> 00:03:00,055
Today we all gotta celebrate,
our family's growing.

24
00:03:01,255 --> 00:03:04,533
I know some are worried,
but I found a contact.

25
00:03:04,535 --> 00:03:08,533
While we wait for Patrizia's shipment,
our ass is covered.

26
00:03:08,535 --> 00:03:12,693
- But we gotta pay in cash.
- And where do we get it?

27
00:03:12,695 --> 00:03:14,173
You'll see.

28
00:03:14,175 --> 00:03:17,455
Now let's celebrate,
let's take a picture.

29
00:03:19,335 --> 00:03:21,215
Give it up for Top Model!

30
00:03:23,295 --> 00:03:25,215
Thanks, guys!

31
00:03:32,575 --> 00:03:34,935
You ready? Make it snappy!

32
00:04:04,735 --> 00:04:08,533
This machine gun's a beast,
I'm gonna raise hell.

33
00:04:08,535 --> 00:04:11,733
Get your piece outta my face.
The fuck are you doing?

34
00:04:11,735 --> 00:04:13,213
Can you smell shit too?

35
00:04:13,215 --> 00:04:15,053
Top Model needs to change his diaper.

36
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:17,173
Get off my ass!

37
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:20,573
- You scared, Goliath?
- He's forgotten how to shoot.

38
00:04:20,575 --> 00:04:23,413
- When did he ever know how to shoot?
- Suck my dick!

39
00:04:23,415 --> 00:04:25,973
Top Model's momma sucks dicks!

40
00:04:25,975 --> 00:04:27,933
- Jerk-off!
- Knock it off.

41
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,973
You always take it out on his mother!

42
00:04:29,975 --> 00:04:32,133
- What's with you?
- You're a dickhead.

43
00:04:32,135 --> 00:04:35,653
A little exercise will do us all good.

44
00:04:35,655 --> 00:04:39,173
- Speak for yourself, with that gut!
- I'm on a diet.

45
00:04:39,175 --> 00:04:42,813
I was just fine in bed
with a tit in my mouth.

46
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,695
You got that right.

47
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,655
What's wrong, Valerio,
you wanna go home?

48
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:54,333
You're so serious...
You wanna spoil the party?

49
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:57,495
Why, are we going to a party?

50
00:05:09,535 --> 00:05:12,695
The armored truck's
entering the tunnel.

51
00:05:16,815 --> 00:05:18,895
You wanna get out?

52
00:05:22,095 --> 00:05:25,853
It's too late,
there's no taxis at this hour.

53
00:05:25,855 --> 00:05:27,655
Walking's a drag.

54
00:05:30,135 --> 00:05:32,533
So let's do it.

55
00:05:32,535 --> 00:05:34,813
- "Walking is a drag..."
- He's a legend!

56
00:05:34,815 --> 00:05:36,935
Let's do this, game on.

57
00:06:12,535 --> 00:06:14,453
Get out!

58
00:06:14,455 --> 00:06:16,533
Come on, guys!

59
00:06:16,535 --> 00:06:21,695
Get out! Get out!

60
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,175
Get outta there!

61
00:06:27,215 --> 00:06:29,935
Fuckers, they got an escort!

62
00:06:32,295 --> 00:06:34,655
Guys!

63
00:06:36,455 --> 00:06:39,533
- Quick!
- Come!

64
00:06:39,535 --> 00:06:41,293
Guys, come on!

65
00:06:41,295 --> 00:06:43,615
Quick!

66
00:06:50,735 --> 00:06:52,895
Motherfuckers!

67
00:06:56,615 --> 00:06:59,533
The cops! We gotta go!

68
00:06:59,535 --> 00:07:01,735
Hurry!

69
00:07:27,015 --> 00:07:28,335
Close it!

70
00:07:33,055 --> 00:07:35,573
Come on, quick!

71
00:07:35,575 --> 00:07:37,375
Call the doctor!

72
00:07:38,695 --> 00:07:40,535
Get the scooter.

73
00:07:41,975 --> 00:07:45,015
- Let's hurry.
- Go!

74
00:07:50,495 --> 00:07:51,815
Close it!

75
00:08:02,295 --> 00:08:04,133
Go.

76
00:08:04,135 --> 00:08:06,853
Get off here.

77
00:08:06,855 --> 00:08:09,173
Go, hurry up!

78
00:08:09,175 --> 00:08:12,095
We'll wait for you over there. Go!

79
00:08:14,415 --> 00:08:15,935
Move!

80
00:08:19,015 --> 00:08:22,015
C'mon, let's get him on the gurney.

81
00:08:24,695 --> 00:08:28,055
- Hold him here!
- Hurry!

82
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:32,255
Quick.

83
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:37,815
You can't come in here.

84
00:08:52,535 --> 00:08:54,933
Enzo...

85
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:57,175
We gotta call Rosa.

86
00:08:59,855 --> 00:09:03,333
Let's wait 'til he makes it
and we can give her the good news.

87
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:05,655
Did you see the state he's in?

88
00:09:07,175 --> 00:09:09,895
I said he's gonna make it.

89
00:09:13,415 --> 00:09:16,733
Do you see why we can't afford
any more fuckups?

90
00:09:16,735 --> 00:09:19,095
You shoulda known they had an escort.

91
00:09:20,775 --> 00:09:23,853
I know what I have to do.

92
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:25,575
I don't think so.

93
00:09:27,455 --> 00:09:30,133
When Nicola came to talk to us,
you ignored him.

94
00:09:30,135 --> 00:09:34,413
Again? You know what your problem is?
You see shit that's not there.

95
00:09:34,415 --> 00:09:37,933
Fine, Enzo, do what you want.

96
00:09:37,935 --> 00:09:40,615
But sooner or later,
they'll get sick of it.

97
00:09:41,775 --> 00:09:43,533
They?

98
00:09:43,535 --> 00:09:47,455
If there's anyone changing
their mind, it's you.

99
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,015
What?

100
00:11:52,015 --> 00:11:53,575
Sasà...

101
00:12:08,855 --> 00:12:11,055
What's happened?

102
00:12:14,495 --> 00:12:15,935
Where's Sasà?

103
00:12:47,615 --> 00:12:49,815
You happy now?

104
00:12:51,095 --> 00:12:53,455
You happy now?

105
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,415
Let's go in.

106
00:13:57,735 --> 00:13:59,495
Bro'...

107
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:10,055
Bro'...

108
00:14:17,095 --> 00:14:21,093
Pure'n'Simple, Sasà woulda done
anything for Enzo,

109
00:14:21,095 --> 00:14:23,173
he woulda even gone to hell.

110
00:14:23,175 --> 00:14:24,853
For real.

111
00:14:24,855 --> 00:14:27,535
Luckily, only he died.

112
00:14:30,975 --> 00:14:34,013
The fuck you looking at, Pure'n'Simple?

113
00:14:34,015 --> 00:14:36,173
Enzo's at home,

114
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:40,373
on that nice sofa he bought
without even doing a mugging.

115
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,773
Are you serious?

116
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:44,693
Enzo has nothing to do with it,

117
00:14:44,695 --> 00:14:48,293
no one could have known
what was gonna happen.

118
00:14:48,295 --> 00:14:50,133
He wants to order everyone around.

119
00:14:50,135 --> 00:14:52,855
Then I say he's responsible
for Top Model's death.

120
00:14:55,135 --> 00:14:57,055
Is that what you think, Goliath?

121
00:15:00,615 --> 00:15:03,095
He's not the only one, Pure'n'Simple.

122
00:15:17,575 --> 00:15:20,135
We'll pretend I didn't hear that.

123
00:15:32,575 --> 00:15:36,333
- I nearly went for him.
- You shouldn't talk in front of Valerio.

124
00:15:36,335 --> 00:15:38,895
What are you talking about?

125
00:15:41,615 --> 00:15:46,253
- I agree with you.
- Why didn't you say anything?

126
00:15:46,255 --> 00:15:49,133
A brother died.

127
00:15:49,135 --> 00:15:52,575
Instead of flinging shit at each other,
we gotta do something.

128
00:15:53,575 --> 00:15:57,253
I don't want to put Enzo on the spot,
I want him to think.

129
00:15:57,255 --> 00:16:00,893
- What the fuck is there to think about?
- About what Nicola tried to tell us.

130
00:16:00,895 --> 00:16:02,215
He was a rat.

131
00:16:04,575 --> 00:16:11,013
That's what Patrizia says.
But I saw him and so did you.

132
00:16:11,015 --> 00:16:15,253
He was talking like he was scared
not like he wanted to screw you.

133
00:16:15,255 --> 00:16:17,415
So what do you think?

134
00:16:19,655 --> 00:16:23,573
Didn't you say the Capaccios
are taking our turf?

135
00:16:23,575 --> 00:16:25,775
So what do we do?

136
00:16:32,615 --> 00:16:35,373
Enzo's a brother, but he's not a boss.

137
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,853
And I don't want to die because
no one's got the balls to tell him.

138
00:16:38,855 --> 00:16:42,973
- I want to talk to the Capaccios.
- You want to make a deal with them?

139
00:16:42,975 --> 00:16:46,133
I want to know what they're up to.

140
00:16:46,135 --> 00:16:48,815
And I want to know if they're
the only ones behind the bust.

141
00:16:50,415 --> 00:16:51,735
And then?

142
00:16:55,375 --> 00:16:57,613
And then we can decide on our future,

143
00:16:57,615 --> 00:17:02,173
whether to stay with them
or with Patrizia or go our own way.

144
00:17:02,175 --> 00:17:03,973
You don't want to tell Enzo?

145
00:17:03,975 --> 00:17:07,415
When it's done we'll tell him,
he'll just have to accept it.

146
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:25,053
Goliath doesn't know what he's saying.
It's the grief talking.

147
00:17:25,055 --> 00:17:27,453
I know.

148
00:17:27,455 --> 00:17:30,175
It's what Valerio says that worries me.

149
00:17:32,015 --> 00:17:34,095
Didn't Valerio tell you anything?

150
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:38,175
No need, I can read his mind.

151
00:17:44,455 --> 00:17:46,575
He thinks it's my fault.

152
00:17:50,015 --> 00:17:51,415
What is it?

153
00:17:56,815 --> 00:17:58,815
We gotta see something.

154
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:25,655
It's Secondigliano.
The drugs have arrived.

155
00:18:28,215 --> 00:18:30,615
You'll see, it'll be all right now.

156
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,055
It's here!

157
00:19:28,535 --> 00:19:30,375
Guys, let's unload.

158
00:19:33,535 --> 00:19:36,213
Easy with this stuff.

159
00:19:36,215 --> 00:19:38,335
Say hello to Donna Patrizia.

160
00:19:40,135 --> 00:19:42,255
Quick, go.

161
00:19:54,775 --> 00:19:57,055
Hurry up.

162
00:20:06,175 --> 00:20:08,095
Bro', finally.

163
00:20:12,215 --> 00:20:14,495
Guys, open this shit.

164
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:21,935
Check out the trash...

165
00:20:23,495 --> 00:20:25,935
That's gross!

166
00:20:27,855 --> 00:20:30,695
Where's Valerio?
Anyone heard from him?

167
00:20:33,935 --> 00:20:37,455
You know he's delicate.
He's probably sleeping.

168
00:20:40,535 --> 00:20:42,215
Smells like shit.

169
00:22:00,255 --> 00:22:03,053
Now you want to talk to us again?

170
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:05,413
This guy does what the fuck he wants.

171
00:22:05,415 --> 00:22:09,013
He wants to talk,
then he doesn't want to talk...

172
00:22:09,015 --> 00:22:11,895
Elia, I don't know
if I want to listen to him.

173
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:21,213
I know you've never liked Patrizia.
It's all the same to me.

174
00:22:21,215 --> 00:22:23,733
In Secondigliano they're raking in
the cash, and we're scraping by.

175
00:22:23,735 --> 00:22:27,335
If you came to tell us what
we already know, you can leave.

176
00:22:29,535 --> 00:22:33,055
Nicola told us the seized shipment
went back on the streets.

177
00:22:34,055 --> 00:22:39,133
I don't know, Elia...
Why did Nicola go talk to him?

178
00:22:39,135 --> 00:22:42,093
Something like that
you'd tell your boss.

179
00:22:42,095 --> 00:22:44,935
Unless you don't trust your boss
anymore either.

180
00:22:46,855 --> 00:22:49,333
And do you know why?

181
00:22:49,335 --> 00:22:51,373
Nicola knew that behind the seizure

182
00:22:51,375 --> 00:22:53,773
there's someone
who doesn't like this truce

183
00:22:53,775 --> 00:22:57,295
because he wants Patrizia
out of the way, like I do.

184
00:23:00,495 --> 00:23:03,053
And you think it's us?

185
00:23:03,055 --> 00:23:06,055
I think you play an important role
in this game.

186
00:23:13,735 --> 00:23:17,773
- And what do you want to do?
- An alliance.

187
00:23:17,775 --> 00:23:20,375
With you and with those
who are with you.

188
00:23:21,895 --> 00:23:24,935
And if we do that, others will follow.

189
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:35,095
Let us think about it.

190
00:23:36,775 --> 00:23:38,255
We'll let you know.

191
00:23:39,575 --> 00:23:41,815
Take him outside.

192
00:23:47,775 --> 00:23:50,055
This guy wants
to take Blue Blood's place.

193
00:23:51,175 --> 00:23:53,255
Son of a bitch!

194
00:23:55,135 --> 00:23:57,655
Friends... Friends, my ass!

195
00:23:59,535 --> 00:24:02,173
Can we trust him?

196
00:24:02,175 --> 00:24:04,455
Last time he ran riot.

197
00:24:06,135 --> 00:24:08,095
But we had fun, right?

198
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:16,530
This goes to Vicaria Vecchia.
Get it there fast.

199
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,850
This goes to Piazza Calenda.

200
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:30,770
Come.

201
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:34,850
Wait.

202
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:41,368
- Where the fuck have you been?
- I had some problems.

203
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,930
What happened?

204
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:47,408
Papa had a heart attack last night.

205
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:50,328
- How is he now?
- He's out of danger.

206
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:52,810
But Mama needs me.

207
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:58,328
You're right, I know how important
it is to have a father.

208
00:24:58,330 --> 00:24:59,730
Valerio....

209
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,050
Your bag's there, come with me.

210
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:15,330
Come. Go to Vico della Pace.

211
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:22,490
- Everything all right?
- He said they'll think about it.

212
00:25:31,370 --> 00:25:35,368
Goliath, if Enzo notices anything,
tell me right away.

213
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:37,090
Don't worry.

214
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:01,648
One week and we'll get it all back.

215
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:04,608
We won't get our lost brothers back.

216
00:26:04,610 --> 00:26:08,008
Enzo, you gotta let it go,
Top Model is dead.

217
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:11,330
Hold your head high and show everybody
we can move forward.

218
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,530
I wasn't talking about him.

219
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,370
I was talking about Valerio.

220
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:48,608
- <i>Yes, who is it?</i>
- A friend of Valerio's.

221
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:50,728
He said I'd find him here.

222
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,170
<i>After the glass door,
at the back on the left.</i>

223
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:24,810
Who are you? Any news of my son?

224
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:28,810
Wait!

225
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:34,688
Why are you looking for him?
What is he doing, what do you know?

226
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:36,930
Get your hands off me.

227
00:27:51,570 --> 00:27:53,570
I need to speak to you.

228
00:28:02,730 --> 00:28:07,008
Stay on Valerio's ass,
I need to know if I can still trust him.

229
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:10,050
Tell me everything you find out.

230
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,528
Goliath, what the fuck's going on?

231
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:19,048
Shouldn't we tell Valerio
Enzo suspects him?

232
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,968
What do we do?

233
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:24,528
The time's come
to take the situation in our hands.

234
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,930
Trust me, or we'll end up
like our brother.

235
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,328
Dude! I said we'd be in touch.

236
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:55,048
There's no time,
my friends want an answer now.

237
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,930
Has Enzo noticed anything?

238
00:29:58,170 --> 00:30:01,010
I don't know, but I can't risk it.
We have to hurry.

239
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:12,808
Listen to me. You're getting yourself
into something bigger than you are.

240
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:15,968
It's not only us behind this shipment,
there's someone more powerful.

241
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,768
<i>You need to speak to him.</i>

242
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:21,448
- <i>All cool anyway?</i>
- Yeah.

243
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:24,368
We'll set up a meeting
for tomorrow night.

244
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,730
All right.

245
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:55,328
What happened, Valerio?
You couldn't wait 'til tomorrow?

246
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:58,848
- Did Enzo tell you anything?
- Why?

247
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:02,408
We gotta hurry, I spoke to Crazy.

248
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:06,850
- What did he say?
- We gotta do it tomorrow night.

249
00:31:08,730 --> 00:31:10,450
The sooner we do it, the better.

250
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,568
What happened?

251
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,088
Well?

252
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,450
Valerio.

253
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:44,368
Tell me.

254
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:47,250
We did what you asked,
we followed him.

255
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:52,490
Valerio spoke to the Capaccios.

256
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:06,570
At this point we want to know.
Is Valerio a brother or not?

257
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:12,570
He was a brother.

258
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,650
Bring him to me.

259
00:33:00,970 --> 00:33:04,168
Hi, Papa.

260
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:07,850
- Valerio.
- You're always here, huh?

261
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:20,968
Your mother's losing her mind,
she hasn't seen you for a year.

262
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:23,728
I'm losing my mind.

263
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:26,128
I can't come home.

264
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,648
Why can't you?

265
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:32,328
What's going on? Does the guy
who was looking for you come into it?

266
00:33:32,330 --> 00:33:36,328
- Who came?
- A guy with one eye....

267
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:38,650
Who are these people, Valerio?

268
00:33:46,810 --> 00:33:49,368
You have to do something for me.

269
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:51,290
Whatever you want.

270
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:33,768
Wanna speak to those
who want war with Secondigliano?

271
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,770
Here we are, speak.

272
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:40,248
So Nicola was right,

273
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:43,688
there really was something big
behind this seizure.

274
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,848
The Levantes.

275
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:48,170
You got a problem, guys?

276
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,130
The offer's still the same.

277
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,570
Put down your guns.

278
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:02,690
Don't move.

279
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,088
What's all this show about?

280
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:21,810
This piece of shit was screwing us all.

281
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,848
He was recording everything
to spy for his boss.

282
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,490
Look in his pockets.

283
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:48,328
<i>Wanna speak to the people
who want war?</i>

284
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:49,808
What does that mean?

285
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:54,048
He wanted to ask you to get rid of Enzo
and Patrizia, but it was a trap.

286
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:58,650
He woulda gone to Enzo with proof
you were behind the bust.

287
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:03,490
I want to do the deal with you.

288
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:07,568
We gotta bring Enzo down.

289
00:37:07,570 --> 00:37:10,330
And who says
you won't do the same thing?

290
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:17,688
No...

291
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:20,730
You know that Enzo is loyal to Patrizia.

292
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,170
You think she won't respond?

293
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,970
Lower your gun.

294
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,210
Lower it.

295
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:39,450
Is it worth keeping an ally like him...

296
00:37:43,490 --> 00:37:45,770
...instead of an enemy like Enzo?

297
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,490
Let's think about it.

298
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:03,330
Let's go, Ciccio.

299
00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:12,170
You're lucky.

300
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:18,370
You're lucky.

301
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:47,490
And Valerio?

302
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:56,250
He was running away, Enzo.

303
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:05,930
I'm sorry.

304
00:39:31,210 --> 00:39:33,850
I'll deal with it all,
don't worry about a thing.

305
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:37,050
Do me a favor.

306
00:39:47,970 --> 00:39:50,090
Valerio has to go home.

307
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:55,610
Whatever you want.

308
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:05,430
