00:01:08,809 --> 00:01:10,966
- Shut up!
- What do you want?

3
00:01:10,968 --> 00:01:13,128
Knock! Be quiet.

4
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:20,005
- Hello, love.
- Shut up, don't move.

5
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:23,484
- Please, don't hurt me.
- Move!

6
00:01:23,486 --> 00:01:26,366
Move, c'mon!
Go in, move!

7
00:01:27,645 --> 00:01:29,243
Move!

8
00:01:29,245 --> 00:01:31,202
Stay there, don't speak.

9
00:01:31,204 --> 00:01:33,203
Sit there and don't move.

10
00:01:33,205 --> 00:01:35,764
Give me the phone.
Santiago, go in there.

11
00:01:42,763 --> 00:01:45,600
Everybody out and go in there.

12
00:01:45,602 --> 00:01:47,960
- What's going on?
- Come out, move!

13
00:01:47,962 --> 00:01:50,440
Get down here, on the floor. Move!

14
00:01:50,442 --> 00:01:53,799
Get down on the floor and don't move.

15
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:55,638
Who's in here? Come out.

16
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,598
You go too, move!
On your knees, like them.

17
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,719
Go get the wallets in the rooms.

18
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:08,039
Don't move. Keep still!
Don't move!

19
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:12,718
Put it in here, hurry!

20
00:02:13,998 --> 00:02:17,117
Everyone get up
and go in there, quick!

21
00:02:18,397 --> 00:02:20,117
Move, you too!

22
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:24,954
Are you still here? Move!

23
00:02:24,956 --> 00:02:29,673
Get on your knees. You too.
On your knees. Let's go.

24
00:02:29,675 --> 00:02:32,353
Carmine, I got everyone's wallets?

25
00:02:32,355 --> 00:02:35,834
- Get up! Where do you keep the money?
- In there.

26
00:02:37,034 --> 00:02:41,551
- What the fuck are you doing?
- You shut up!

27
00:02:41,553 --> 00:02:45,151
You shut up! Shut up!

28
00:02:45,153 --> 00:02:51,311
Shut up, you hear me?
Shut up or I'll kill you.

29
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,990
Give me the money, hurry up.

30
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:03,907
It's all here, I swear.
Now go, please!

31
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:05,949
Santiago, let's go!

32
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:35,504
The Holy Virgin sent you,
Donna Patrizia.

33
00:03:41,903 --> 00:03:43,383
Hello?

34
00:03:45,062 --> 00:03:46,822
Okay, be right there.

35
00:03:50,182 --> 00:03:52,061
- We gotta go.
- All right.

36
00:03:56,421 --> 00:03:59,618
- Donna Patrizia, excuse me.
- Watch it! Mind your manners.

37
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:01,138
It's important.

38
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:03,417
Don't worry,
tomorrow we'll fix everything.

39
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:05,139
Thanks anyway.

40
00:04:51,051 --> 00:04:53,171
Let's see if you learnt...

41
00:04:54,571 --> 00:04:58,450
- Who is in charge here?
- Patrizia.

42
00:04:59,731 --> 00:05:02,930
Donna Patrizia! Who is it, your sister?

43
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:06,447
- What do you say?
- Donna Patrizia.

44
00:05:06,449 --> 00:05:09,089
- Louder!
- Donna Patrizia.

45
00:05:10,728 --> 00:05:14,285
Scumbags, wash your mouth out
before you say her name.

46
00:05:14,287 --> 00:05:16,128
Nicola.

47
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:25,086
Whose kids are you?

48
00:05:27,805 --> 00:05:29,245
No one.

49
00:05:31,404 --> 00:05:33,805
Dad's in jail in Secondigliano.

50
00:05:35,044 --> 00:05:36,484
And your mom?

51
00:05:38,763 --> 00:05:41,281
Mom...

52
00:05:41,283 --> 00:05:43,163
Mom's dead.

53
00:05:48,802 --> 00:05:52,481
- Where do you live?
- In Secondigliano.

54
00:05:54,241 --> 00:05:58,400
With my big sister and a little brother.

55
00:06:14,198 --> 00:06:20,355
You and your brother are just kids,
but here you grow up fast.

56
00:06:20,357 --> 00:06:21,917
Don't forget that.

57
00:06:25,555 --> 00:06:28,274
- Leave him alone.
- What?

58
00:06:28,276 --> 00:06:29,875
Nicola, come.

59
00:06:37,434 --> 00:06:39,231
Do they belong to anyone?

60
00:06:39,233 --> 00:06:42,550
They work on their own,
they're not under anyone.

61
00:06:42,552 --> 00:06:45,031
They need to understand
how the world works.

62
00:06:45,033 --> 00:06:48,030
Get them a job and stay on them.

63
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:51,431
They're a couple of pissants
who don't listen to no one.

64
00:06:52,831 --> 00:06:56,510
- Can we trust them?
- We'll see.

65
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:00,308
Nicola...

66
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:04,267
I know you think you should
command with a stick,

67
00:07:04,269 --> 00:07:07,508
but then the stick breaks
and you've seen it.

68
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,188
We gotta change strategy.

69
00:08:29,335 --> 00:08:32,414
Where have you been?
I've been looking for you all day.

70
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:36,452
Give it to me,
I'll show you how to play.

71
00:08:36,454 --> 00:08:37,814
Well?

72
00:08:47,732 --> 00:08:49,489
What have you done?

73
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:51,732
What happened to you?
What have you done?

74
00:08:54,011 --> 00:08:55,531
Nothing.

75
00:08:58,530 --> 00:09:01,450
Santiago, what happened?

76
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:05,649
I said nothing happened, all right?

77
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:14,605
It's you, it's always you.
You're leading him down the wrong path.

78
00:09:14,607 --> 00:09:18,367
Leave the kid alone,
I don't want him to end up like you.

79
00:09:19,567 --> 00:09:22,166
What are you gonna do about it?

80
00:09:24,606 --> 00:09:28,525
He's still gotta eat, I didn't prepare
anything yet, you take care of it.

81
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:04,909
BOLOGNA CENTRAL STATION

82
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,812
- Want anything?
- Another time.

83
00:12:32,814 --> 00:12:37,054
There's a million euros in the car
out front, for the down payment.

84
00:12:40,493 --> 00:12:43,172
- When the job's done, you get the rest.
- All right.

85
00:12:45,213 --> 00:12:47,890
Why didn't we see each other in Naples?

86
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:50,891
- Problems?
- No, I had stuff to do in Bologna.

87
00:13:13,407 --> 00:13:15,566
Can I help you?

88
00:13:15,568 --> 00:13:17,765
There should be a booking for Ferreri.

89
00:13:17,767 --> 00:13:19,367
I'll check right away.

90
00:13:22,686 --> 00:13:26,763
- Fifth floor, room 501.
- Thank you.

91
00:13:26,765 --> 00:13:28,285
Thank you.

92
00:15:41,703 --> 00:15:43,621
Counselor.

93
00:15:43,623 --> 00:15:46,342
- Did you find it easily?
- No problem.

94
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,700
This way, counselor.

95
00:16:16,337 --> 00:16:19,375
This is the sales contract for the dump.

96
00:16:19,377 --> 00:16:24,334
For you there's 20,000 euros up front,
a repayment schedule for the bank debt

97
00:16:24,336 --> 00:16:28,214
and we'll give you something
for the bank guarantees.

98
00:16:28,216 --> 00:16:29,693
And then?

99
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:33,332
There's time for the paperwork
to go through before closing.

100
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:36,574
Meanwhile, I'll put a figurehead in,
one of our guys.

101
00:16:39,213 --> 00:16:42,930
I don't have any intention at 60

102
00:16:42,932 --> 00:16:46,772
of having them come to get me
at six in the morning.

103
00:16:52,092 --> 00:16:53,931
You need to relax.

104
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,568
You're in clover.

105
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,489
All I want is reassurance
that you're doing things by the book.

106
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:10,086
- I'm handing you a structure...
- Pasanelli...

107
00:17:10,088 --> 00:17:13,287
You've always tried to do things
by the book, right?

108
00:17:15,528 --> 00:17:18,565
And what have you accomplished?

109
00:17:18,567 --> 00:17:22,326
In two years 500,000 euros profit
and 800,000 in debt.

110
00:17:23,486 --> 00:17:26,643
If I come here now
and I repay those debts,

111
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:29,125
do you think I'm doing it all
by the book?

112
00:17:30,484 --> 00:17:32,205
No.

113
00:17:50,561 --> 00:17:52,881
- Yo, what do you want?
- A piece.

114
00:17:55,561 --> 00:17:57,400
Give me a piece.

115
00:18:15,957 --> 00:18:17,437
Let's go.

116
00:19:02,390 --> 00:19:03,989
So little?

117
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:08,669
Boys...

118
00:19:10,828 --> 00:19:13,467
After what you did it's too much.

119
00:19:14,948 --> 00:19:16,867
Now get out of here.

120
00:19:30,264 --> 00:19:32,823
You did a good job.

121
00:19:32,825 --> 00:19:36,262
If you behave,
there's a monthly payment for you too.

122
00:19:36,264 --> 00:19:38,703
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

123
00:20:06,659 --> 00:20:09,056
The deal with our friend is done.

124
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:12,616
- Good, it's already full here.
- All the paperwork's done.

125
00:20:12,618 --> 00:20:15,815
We can send the garbage
to the new plant from tomorrow.

126
00:20:15,817 --> 00:20:19,375
How the fuck can you stand
this disgusting stink?

127
00:20:19,377 --> 00:20:23,096
What stink? The only thing
I can smell here is money, Fabrizio.

128
00:20:28,615 --> 00:20:31,894
In the last three days we've treated
three tons of garbage.

129
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:37,812
That shit is the finished product,
ready to be trucked out.

130
00:20:37,814 --> 00:20:41,171
The construction business
is the biggest we have.

131
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:44,972
And we have as much raw material
as we need, infinite.

132
00:22:17,596 --> 00:22:19,955
- All good?
- <i>Yes.</i>

133
00:22:19,957 --> 00:22:23,234
<i>Soon, tons of reinforced concrete
will be ready.</i>

134
00:22:23,236 --> 00:22:26,233
Are you coming back?

135
00:22:26,235 --> 00:22:30,075
I still have something to do in Bologna.
I'm staying overnight.

136
00:22:34,553 --> 00:22:36,514
- <i>Dad?</i>
- All right.

137
00:23:36,263 --> 00:23:40,381
It's just you didn't tell me
where we're going tonight,

138
00:23:40,383 --> 00:23:42,503
so I bought this.

139
00:23:44,142 --> 00:23:46,182
It's a surprise, I told you.

140
00:23:47,502 --> 00:23:49,861
Don't be silly! How do I look?

141
00:23:56,141 --> 00:23:58,020
You look beautiful, Patrizia.

142
00:24:24,455 --> 00:24:27,174
Hand me the cape,
I'll put it away for you.

143
00:24:27,176 --> 00:24:28,535
Sure.

144
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:31,972
I'll be right back.

145
00:24:31,974 --> 00:24:33,774
May I?

146
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,529
- Mickey!
- My man!

147
00:24:52,531 --> 00:24:54,649
- Dude!
- How are you?

148
00:24:54,651 --> 00:24:58,728
- Good! I'm glad you came.
- Me too. This is Patrizia.

149
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,530
Fabio, my pleasure.

150
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:06,847
I'm the guy who put up with five years
of university with the out-of-towner.

151
00:25:06,849 --> 00:25:08,489
You put up with me?

152
00:25:10,048 --> 00:25:13,285
- And where are you from?
- Naples.

153
00:25:13,287 --> 00:25:17,045
- You found a girl from your area.
- Of course!

154
00:25:17,047 --> 00:25:21,324
You know Mickey, right?
In the end, he went home.

155
00:25:21,326 --> 00:25:25,765
He did the right thing.
And what do you do, Patrizia?

156
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:30,404
I do more or less what he does.

157
00:25:34,124 --> 00:25:35,884
Let's go in here.

158
00:25:37,323 --> 00:25:39,164
Let's park here.

159
00:26:05,239 --> 00:26:07,438
Excuse me! Two vodka shots.

160
00:26:37,434 --> 00:26:39,951
- Mickey!
- Eleonora!

161
00:26:39,953 --> 00:26:42,030
- How are you?
- Good, you?

162
00:26:42,032 --> 00:26:44,271
All good. This is Patrizia.

163
00:26:44,273 --> 00:26:47,072
- Nice to meet you, Eleonora.
- Nice to meet you.

164
00:26:48,711 --> 00:26:52,789
- What are you doing here?
- We came to get a drink. You?

165
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:55,388
I always come here.

166
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,910
- It's good to see you.
- Me too.

167
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:01,390
Right... How long are you staying?

168
00:27:02,749 --> 00:27:04,829
Just long enough to have a drink.

169
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:08,828
Mickey... wait.

170
00:27:14,708 --> 00:27:19,184
- All right. Maybe I'll see you later.
- Maybe.

171
00:27:19,186 --> 00:27:22,506
Have a good night. Bye, Fabrizia.

172
00:27:28,905 --> 00:27:30,705
Everything okay, Patrizia?

173
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:45,142
It's no good, you need to change it.

174
00:27:47,542 --> 00:27:50,381
Sorry, can you make another one?
It's no good.

175
00:28:12,018 --> 00:28:13,777
Patrizia!

176
00:28:15,457 --> 00:28:17,216
Patrizia, stop!

177
00:28:41,332 --> 00:28:44,091
I'm Carmine,
he's my brother Santiago.

178
00:28:44,093 --> 00:28:45,650
Pleasure, Ilenia.

179
00:28:45,652 --> 00:28:47,572
- She's Anna.
- Pleasure.

180
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:53,771
- Wanna dance?
- Let's dance.

181
00:29:04,129 --> 00:29:06,246
- Want some coke?
- No, I got no money.

182
00:29:06,249 --> 00:29:08,648
- It's a present.
- Wait.

183
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:11,686
What happened?

184
00:29:11,688 --> 00:29:14,246
He wants to give us some coke,
what do we do?

185
00:29:14,248 --> 00:29:16,727
What do we do? We take it.

186
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:19,926
Okay, let's go.

187
00:30:12,598 --> 00:30:15,237
- Turn it off.
- No, or else they'll hear us.

188
00:30:51,112 --> 00:30:54,229
- Santiago, got something to snort with?
- No, nothing.

189
00:30:54,231 --> 00:30:55,910
You got anything?

190
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:00,270
- Turn off the water.
- Here.

191
00:32:10,418 --> 00:32:13,377
- Got any more?
- Wait here.

192
00:32:24,015 --> 00:32:26,053
What are you going to do?
We're outta cash.

193
00:32:26,055 --> 00:32:28,095
You'll see.

194
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,410
- Give me 20.
- Another one?

195
00:33:00,570 --> 00:33:02,369
Another one.

196
00:33:07,529 --> 00:33:09,526
Bro', you got five?

197
00:33:09,528 --> 00:33:11,767
- Yeah, you want ten?
- Give me ten.

198
00:33:18,207 --> 00:33:20,524
Guys!

199
00:33:20,526 --> 00:33:22,606
You find it? Let's go.

200
00:33:34,124 --> 00:33:36,203
Catch those little shits!

201
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,757
There they are, turn around.

202
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:07,118
Turn!

203
00:34:13,637 --> 00:34:15,517
We'll go in this way.

204
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,188
Guys, they're up there.

205
00:34:58,190 --> 00:35:01,909
We found them, hurry up.

206
00:35:27,385 --> 00:35:29,702
Come out! Better for everyone if you do!

207
00:35:29,704 --> 00:35:32,344
There they are, little shits.

208
00:35:37,703 --> 00:35:42,340
Now you run away, piece of shit!
Now you have to run away!

209
00:35:42,342 --> 00:35:44,940
Did you have fun being an asshole?

210
00:35:44,942 --> 00:35:47,942
Did you have fun, you piece of shit?

211
00:35:52,221 --> 00:35:55,419
What the fuck
are you doing on our turf?

212
00:35:55,421 --> 00:35:59,779
- Who do you belong to?
- We're from Secondigliano.

213
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,057
We're under Patrizia.

214
00:36:04,059 --> 00:36:09,176
That ugly bitch Patrizia
brings her trash onto our turf?

215
00:36:09,178 --> 00:36:13,098
- Is that right?
- They're just talking shit, Enzo.

216
00:36:20,576 --> 00:36:22,456
Let's take it easy, guys.

217
00:36:25,495 --> 00:36:28,495
I'm not getting my hands dirty
with Patrizia's shit.

218
00:36:36,934 --> 00:36:38,733
Patrizia?

219
00:37:13,407 --> 00:37:16,887
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

220
00:37:22,086 --> 00:37:25,445
- Welcome back, Donna Patrizia.
- Hi, Nicola.

221
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,361
Leave us.

222
00:38:04,119 --> 00:38:06,236
Well?

223
00:38:06,238 --> 00:38:08,878
- Sorry, Donna Patrizia.
- Yeah, sorry...

224
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:11,358
How could you?

225
00:38:12,438 --> 00:38:16,275
I stick my neck out
to give you an opportunity

226
00:38:16,277 --> 00:38:18,277
and how do you repay me?

227
00:38:19,876 --> 00:38:22,116
You go dicking around in Forcella?

228
00:38:23,755 --> 00:38:26,596
- We were just joking.
- Joking?

229
00:38:28,675 --> 00:38:31,714
If it was a joke,
why aren't you laughing, Carmine?

230
00:38:34,194 --> 00:38:38,111
No, Donna Patrizia! Please!

231
00:38:38,113 --> 00:38:42,031
He's my little slave,
he does everything I tell him to.

232
00:38:42,033 --> 00:38:44,992
Take it out on me, not my brother.

233
00:38:48,471 --> 00:38:49,952
Carmine...

234
00:38:51,111 --> 00:38:52,551
Carmine...

235
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:58,190
It's not that I don't want to be defied
by two snot-noses like you...

236
00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:03,429
It's just that I can't.

237
00:39:23,346 --> 00:39:25,025
Make them disappear.

238
00:39:33,784 --> 00:39:36,021
Hello, Enzo.

239
00:39:36,023 --> 00:39:38,624
Thank you, I took care of it personally.

240
00:39:40,383 --> 00:39:42,702
What will we tell their family now?

241
00:39:45,662 --> 00:39:47,782
They only had a sister.

242
00:39:50,461 --> 00:39:54,421
If they come, tell them I treat everyone
in Secondigliano like my children.

243
00:39:55,461 --> 00:39:58,420
But if they disrespect me,
they have to pay.

244
00:40:21,576 --> 00:40:23,695
Good evening.
Would you like to order?

245
00:40:26,256 --> 00:40:28,855
Can you send him to me?

246
00:40:34,134 --> 00:40:35,894
All right.

247
00:41:05,448 --> 00:41:07,609
I'm sorry, he says he can't.

248
00:41:08,808 --> 00:41:10,648
Can I help you?

249
00:41:14,248 --> 00:41:15,967
No, thanks.

250
00:41:28,644 --> 00:41:30,285
Who was she?

251
00:41:32,804 --> 00:41:34,124
Nobody.

252
00:42:05,743 --> 00:42:10,744
